I drove to work this morning, expecting to get there 30 minutes early. got there 15 minutes late. traffic was backed up for miles around the airport.

I got in to work and the building was deserted, but radios were blaring from every other office. World trade center collapsed. Two jumbo jets hijacked, crashed into the towers. Another plane crash in the pentagon.

I'm in shock. In London, Natalie was trying to get news. Relayed what I could until they found a radio station that had picked up the story. Airports are closed, public buildings are being evacuated. Terrorism on an unprecedented scale -- George W is three miles underground right now.

This is one of those moments where you know the world will never be the same again.
