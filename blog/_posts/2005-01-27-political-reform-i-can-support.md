It's 1am and a fresh support call from work has me up late. Wheee! At least CNN can be counted on to deliver fresh surrealism to my desktop. To wit: <em><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/01/26/coxboxing.reut/index.html">"Lawmaker wants tiny boxing gloves on roosters."</a></em> 

<blockquote>State Sen. Frank Shurden, a Democrat from Henryetta and a long-time defender of cockfighting, said the ban had wiped out a $100-million business.
To try to revive it, he has proposed that roosters wear little boxing gloves attached to their spurs, as well as lightweight, chicken-sized vests configured with electronic sensors to record hits and help keep score.</blockquote>

Thank you, Oklahoma.
