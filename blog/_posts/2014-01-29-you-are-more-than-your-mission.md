title: You are more than your mission
summary: When we're part of a project we care about, the signs of burnout can sneak up on us.

Earlier this week, a piece that I wrote was published on The Pastry Box. It's about the self-imposed and social pressures that can lead to [personal burnout and community dysfunction](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/jeff-eaton/2014-january-26).

> No mission, project, or community is big enough to sacrifice your health or well being; your responsibilities to yourself, your family, and your loved ones are just as important as a worthy cause or an investorâ€™s profits. If a cause or a project can only survive by chewing you up, *it deserves to die*.

[Growing up in a religious community](https://medium.com/growing-up-goddy), then working on the staff of a large church, was an interesting education for me. I learned about the complex dynamics of volunteer-dependent organizations, and I saw first-hand how social pressures can keep people grinding away at work that's killing them. In a mission-based organization, there's a real connection between how much you *do* and how much you *care*: workaholics are presumed to care more about the mission than those who stay at home, and labor can easily become a substitute for piety. It's the [Mary/Martha](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A38-42) thing writ large.

The shaming and scolding that evolves out of that (like a PBS pledge drive, but for work instead of money) is usually intended to spur folks on the sideline to action. Often, though, it's heard loudest by the tender-hearted people who are already overloaded and overwhelmed. Not enough people to keep the soup kitchen open late? *You should work longer.* Too few helpers to set up chairs before the Sunday service? *If you really loved God, you'd be there...*

When I started working in open source about a decade ago, I was struck by the similarities. Although the mission was different, the social dynamics and lionization of self-sacrificing super-volunteers was the same. It's hard to balance passion for a mission or cause with a commitment to self-care, but it's necessary. If we don't do it for ourselves *and* encourage it in other community-members, we're slowly destroying the people who care the most.
