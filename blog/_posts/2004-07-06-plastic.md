&lt;hunter&gt; When I took my motorcycle class, I was asked if I played polo.  I'm not quite sure what I wore/did/said that gave off "polo player" cues.
&lt;notyou&gt; the jodphurs?
&lt;verb&gt; The giant croquet mallet strapped to your back?
&lt;Ajax&gt; The horse parked outside?
&lt;electroboy&gt; the swimming pool and the ball?
&lt;verb&gt; The silly little hat?
&lt;erik&gt; maybe your aristocratic manner and patrician accent?
&lt;notyou&gt; the air of privilege?
&lt;erik&gt; the small kicks you administered to the help to encourage greater dispatch?
&lt;Ajax&gt; The last name "Braithwaite-Huffington?"
&lt;electroboy&gt; possibly the knit shirt with the logo?
&lt;Ajax&gt; Apparently we can go on like this all day.
&lt;electroboy&gt; and so we shall.
