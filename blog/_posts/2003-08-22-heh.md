A few times, I've summed up my dating life with one phrase: "Even asking me out was a violation of the terms of her parole."

<a href="http://www.newhousenews.com/archive/story1c031102.html">it's not a joke.</a> At the time, I only knew her as <a href="http://www.geocities.com/stopaglaia/thecast.html">Alexis Stanton</a>. <a href="http://pub15.bravenet.com/forum/show.php?usernum=1263545817&cpv=1">And I'm not even the only one she plaigarized!</a> 

The <a href="http://www.geocities.com/stopaglaia/articles.html">articles date back</a> to the early 90's...

It's nice to know that even back then, my keen suspicion of women who seemed interested was serving me well!
