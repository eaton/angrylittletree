Jerry called about the office. "We're repainting. What color do you want?"

Dave asked why.

"Well. Somebody came in and... kicked the walls in and smashed bottles on the walls. Just trashed things, really. We're repainting it now." Jerry paused. "It was somebody with a key, so we rekeyed the locks."

Later, Dave talked to a friend on county election board. Dave mentioned all this stuff that's going on, and they had apparently had a chuckle about it. Later, though, his friend and asked him about the name of the lawyer who'd disappeared, leaving the office open. Dave answered, and Bob paused. "It's starting to make sense." Another pause. "I have to go, Dave... I'll talk to you later," and hung up.

I think maybe the new office is haunted.
