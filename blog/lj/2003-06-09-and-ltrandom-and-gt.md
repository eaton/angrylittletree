<a href="http://www.cri.ch/photos/gallery.php3?dir=g8dimanche" target="_blank">The recent G8 Summit in Switzerland saw protestors locking horns with police. I wonder if anyone even understands what issues were involved with the Summit. Ironically, images of the riot that followed</a> <a href="http://www.cri.ch/photos/g8dimanche/20030601112312.jpg" target="_blank">are both strangely compelling</a> <a href="http://www.cri.ch/photos/g8dimanche/20030601053758.jpg" target="_blank">and seemingly crafted for an Adidas ad campaign.</a>
