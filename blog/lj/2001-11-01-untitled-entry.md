<i>God will not make me think like Jesus, 
I have to do it myself,
I have to bring every thought into captivity
to the obedience of Christ.
...
If Christ's own disciples were guilty of thinking "as men think, not as God thinks," are we likely to do better? How do we know we are not thinking as Americans (or English, French, or Australians) think and not as God thinks? Have we checked that we are not closer to the twentieth-century (or sixteenth or first-century) mind than the mind of Christ? Is our agenda closer to a liberal or conservative agenda than to the agenda of the kingdom of God? Are we more like the profile of Washingtonians (or New Yorkers, Los Angelenos, or Londoners) or of lawyers (or doctors and teachers) than of followers of Christ?</I>

good stuff. i've been talking more and more with a couple of close friends about the whole idea of heart, mind, and understanding. it's so easy for me to demand understanding. to force the world to present itself plainly or simply, to rail against the things that i can't grasp. can't wrap my mind around and slot into my clean, crisp picture of how the world works. of how people work.

sometimes understanding is a burden, i think.

we want the tangible, rather than the true. the understandable rather than the real. bah. we suck!
