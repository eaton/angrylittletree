Google has opened up their full usenet archive. dating back to 1981, or some ungodly year like that.

i googled.

<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=afceaton%40aol.com&start=30&hl=en&scoring=d&rnum=38&selm=2kh06a%2487o%40rmg01.prod.aol.net&filter=0">i found my first post to usenet.</a>

ever.

i fear.

naturally, it was a clueless me-too post.

far spookier was digging up threads in which i met people for the first time who are now old friends... or crossed paths with individuals i would only get to know years later. even infamous rec.music.christian threads that spawned in-jokes in use to this day.

sigh. what a potent, potent drug, usenet archives...
