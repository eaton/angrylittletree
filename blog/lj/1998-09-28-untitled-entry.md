i'm afraid that i'm finally doing it -- slipping, missing all the things that are happening and letting my life slip back into the unrecorded. it scares me -- i feel like, as long as i have these thnigs recorded, these events in my life, i can look back and it will all make sense with perspective. that the events and the little things and the big things will all arrange themselves into a narrative the way They Should, and the present will make sense.

if i don't... if i let myself slip, then there won't be any /past/ for me. that my focus will be gone and i'll drift aimlessly, or something like that. i don't have the right words to explain what i fear, but it's there. the worry that things irreplacable will be lost.

i find myself desperately grabbing for events to write down -- groping for the things of signifigance that I can commit to words so they'll stay with me forever.

i remember riding home from the plumb show with ben and beck; playing six degrees of kevin bacon with him and marveling at the frightening linking abilities. i remember the sensations this weekend, of my kite snapping into the air on a gust of wind and soaring. the line humming, taut, as i tugged and seduced the kite back to the ground, bucking and jerking in the wind. realizing i was wearing a huge grin loving every minute of it.

of talking to alison and feeling such /peace/ about the decision i made to be her friend, not more... of knowing that the tiny echo in the back of my soul would grow louder eventually. whispering to me that i'm alone. i /wish/ i were totally and perfectly content. i /wish/ that i did not desire more. that i did not desire o 'have' someone and share my soul with them. to hear them run out of words to speak to me and feel the same.

on saturday i gouged my hand open with a chisel while working on the windows. discussion of tetanus shot ensued, and in the resulting inquiries it was determined that it would, indeed, be a good idea. over the last couple of days i've been dreading it -- hating the idea wit a passion. i HATE needles and i cannot figure out why. but it's over with now, only a dull ache in my shoulder to remind me of the prick. my stomach was knotted for hours.

finished the net glossary, and david laughed as he edited it. "Well, we know what technologies YOU like, jeff..." apparently my use of the words 'savvy' and 'emerging standard' were flags for my pet tech. *chuckle*
