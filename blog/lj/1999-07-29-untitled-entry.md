it's almost one in the morning, and today has been quite the buzz. political hijinks followed the introduction of the willow creek church site -- they moved their site up a level in the willowcreek.org domain, putting it over the association site. the result is that we're a level down, and people who come looking for us find them instead. much confusion and loss of revenue are sure to follow. an emergency huddle followed this discovery, and quick verbal dancing produced a good series of bullet points for mark kemink to take to the hed of the willow church web project. hopefully it'll pan out.

other news: willow creek has really, really good roast beef sandwiches. brian the minesotan, one of the RMC guys and the moderator of the rmc elitists list, came out of the metaphorical closet regarding a charade he pulled on someone. apparently he's been posing as the online love interest of one of rmc's more annoying people for almost six months. his mention of this on the elitists list led to massive heated discussion and the eventual revelation of the secret to the target. i'm glad i wasn't involved...

other issues were put on the table and subsequently resolved -- i'm now the point man for a 'structure revamp.' not design per se, just a structural engineering overhaul. it's amazingly cool, because it's a chance to apply some of the concepts i've been reading about and studying, real world. usability engineering, user-centric design, ecommerce optimization, etc etc... I convinced them that design should follow structure, and that the design firm should go on hold until we have the structure hammered out...

after work i met up with the gang; watched Enemy of the State and cheered Will Smith as he ran like heck and got shot at. Tried to get 7.5.0 installed properly on Jason's zip disk, while the installer balked at the model of the machine... On a whim I held down command-option-control-shift k-o-m-d-p... double-clicked it with both fists nailing modifiers.

and it worked. i cackled, and jason stood laughing in awe. "That was <i>so</i> Jedi, man."
