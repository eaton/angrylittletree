So I've been AWOL from Livejournal for quite a while, haven't I? Yes, yes I have.

Things have been pretty crazy on all fronts this month. A lot of things have been changing at Fusion, the [bible study|small group|roving band of lunatics] I've been a part of since 2001. There's a fork in the road for us coming in the near futurÃ«, and it's tricky and sticky navigating it. What the group will become? What's our purpose is in getting together? What's our relationship to a couple of local churches, and what will look like in the future? They're questions that require a lot of thought, a lot of prayer, and a lot of conttemplation. Stressful in some ways, but really exciting in others.

The challanges associated with that on a personal level are interesting, too. I spent a lot of my life dreaming up ways to 'Build Big Systems' and 'Implement Grandiose Plans'... Some of that was for the right reasons. Some of it was tied up with my desire to 'be part of something big,' to Be Recognized By Others, and to be respected and admired. Over the past couple of years I've been learning, slowly but surely, to focus on the internal things -- on being Good(tm) in that Zenlike way, on learning to listen to God's voice, on centering myself and living in a balanced way. Those are all dramatically different motivations, and the resulting outlook on stuff like Fusion is one that I'm feeling more and more comfortable with.

In other news, I got strep, which sucked verily. Having your uvula swell to the size of a small fish is unpleasant in ways I'd never really contemplated before. Despite my concerns about the creation of immunized superbugs, I jumped at antibiotics and embraced them happily, future of humanity be damned. I'm such a sellout, but in 48 hours I could swallow happily. w00t!

I turned 27.

That last one's got me in a slightly weird mood -- not in a bad way, just... weird. I remember being 24 pretty clearly. To think that in the same amount of time I'll be turning <i>thirty</i> is sobering and odd. I don't feel old, I just feel <i>me.</i> Meeting 18 year olds and even 20 year olds, though, and thinking that they're <i>really really young</i> is a strange experience, though. It's a bit of a consolation to remember that soon they'll probably think I'm morphing into a tremendously unhip geezer. I've always wanted to grow up into the old guy on the porch shaking a cane at kids who run on his grass. <a href="http://web.inter.nl.net/users/C.Talboom/muppets/statwald.htm">Statler and Waldorf</a>, here I come!

The last big piece of news is... hm. Yowza.

In a nutshell, I'm dating Catherine -- a.k.a. Cat, a.k.a. Girl Type X. It's splendid. It's amazing. I grin stupidly just thinking about <i>saying</i> that she's my girlfriend, y'know?  

It seems strangely distant and dry and academic, trying to put it all into words. She's my friend, and she's my <i>girlfriend (!!!)</i> and we've connected on a lot of levels that I'd sort of written off for a long time. Those who've been watching the progress of my dating life over the past year or so know that I'd all but abandoned the idea of finding someone to connect with on both a spiritual, intellectual, and personality level...

And then bam!

There she is.

And here she is.

And life with her is good, and I smile, and it's <i>healthy,</i> too. With communication, and concerns brought up and discussed rather than shoved under the rug. With vulnerability and laughter and heated, stimulating discussions about literature and philosophy and art. With praying together and learning about each other. With nice kissing, too. (w00t.) Her parents seem to like me and I like them. My parents like her! And she seems to like them. And she plays a mean game of MarioKart. It's so tremendously... drama-free, and smooth. Not without challenges, but... challenges of a different kind. The good and right and growing kind.

Life is good, y'know?

Sometimes, life is very good.

Hi, Catherine.

I'm a lucky, lucky boy.
