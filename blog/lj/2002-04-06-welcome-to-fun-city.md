9 hours. 8PM to 5AM.

One massive shadowrun session.

The worst, worst, WORST stretch of bad rolls ever. My decker rolled a critical failure *CALLING A CAB* and passed out in the safehouse.

Our hitter stole a moped to drive the kid we were saving to the hospital. Critical failure. Hits a bump, *drops the kid onto the street.*

Our backup hitter with the SMG criticals. *Gun jams.*

Our fixer gives chase after the ninja we're supposed to take down. He *criticals and passes out in the middle of the street from blood loss.*

We liiiivvvve! Hahah.

Here's to being lucky dogs.
