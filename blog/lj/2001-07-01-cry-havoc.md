Since Friday morning, I have clocked 29 billable hours at work. I slept on the floor of my office, since I have no desk, and just finished up my last minute emergency shopping for cornerstone.

I watched four episodes of Reboot on DVD at Fur's house. Thank you, Bren.

I packed two duffels, one toiletries back, two wallets, one sleeping bag, one air mattress, and a box of latex gloves (just in case).

In four hours, I will wake up and hit the road running.

It's Cornerstone time.
