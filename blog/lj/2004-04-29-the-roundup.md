This one's a video. Very high-concept trailer for a company that's working on robotics. Watch some real present-day robots in action, and you know this one's a long ways offf, but not outside the realm of possibility. The body isn't the hardest part with a system like the one in the video -- it's the AI to drive the thing. You think friendly fire is bad <i>now?</i> Wait until C3P0 is carrying a SIG550.

<i>"Why had he done it? ‘Because the Hindu nation had been threatened’, he said, ‘Hindus were treated as second-class citizens in our own land. If Hindu laws like the ban on cow slaughter could not be upheld in India, where would they be respected?"</i>

<i>"Status - Feasibility of many of the basic concepts has been demonstrated. Preliminary results using passive (without on-chip transistors) regeneration-type neural interfaces indicated that recording from, and stimulation of, peripheral nerves in the rat is possible at durations of over one year. While the initial design of these devices was not refined for optimal nerve regeneration, it allowed the demonstration of the basic principle and the durability of devices fabricated with the process developed for this purpose."</i>

Tuvalu is that tiny little island off the coast of New Zealand whose lucky name landed it the <i>.tv</i> domain hierarchy back in the days of the internet boom. It held onto the hierarchy during heated bidding, and planned to turn the hot television-themed domain-business into a ticket to riches. That evaporated once the bubble popped, but now -- get this -- the island is <i>sinking.</i> In a few years, it might be gone altogether. Once that happens, the UN says it can maintain its national identity and holdings, even without land. That's right, kids -- Tuvalu might convert itself into a virtual nation. Doens't that just kick ass?

As always, Defensetech delivers.

Yet another location -- this time a mall in Washington -- offering free wifi. With more PDAs and laptops featuring wifi hardware off the shelf, I think we're seeing the first wobbles of a <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/books.html" target="_blank">tipping point</a> for connectivity.
