It's a fundamental rule of the universe -- if you date a geek, your computer <i>will</i> at some point get a makeover. If you date an <i>obsessive</i> geek who lives ten minutes from a Fry's Electronics, your computer will at some point be <i>pimped out.</i>

<a href="http://delicateeffigy.livejournal.com">delicateeffigy</a> is certainly no exception to this rule.

The plan was simple -- I'd procured a good motherboard for free thanks to <a href="http://www.dealnews.com">dealnews</a>, and had a 1.8gHz celeron lying around from a previous machine makeover. While the Celeron is no speed demon, it'd be a definite step up from her current 600mHz Celeron. And if she needed to upgrade in the future, it would be as simple as popping in a new P4. Jason and I would pop the new motherboard into her existing case, hook things up, and bam! Clean and simple.

Catherine hauled her HP over to my house last night after work, and Jason and I began our dark mechinations. Ten minutes in, there were snags. Her case was a microtower, not a full ATX, and the motherboard was too large by far. The video card from one of my old machines didn't seem to be booting properly, and the CD ROM burner in her existing machine... umm...

It...

Wasn't 1337 enough.

Yeah.

Fast-forward three hours, two squealing-tires geek runs to Fry's Electronics and Tiger Direct, one trip to Portillo's, and ten minutes with a dremel. The result of the evening is a tricky philosophical quandry. With a new case, new drive, new OS, new video card, half a gig of RAM, new motherboard, whisper-silent 400W power supply, faster processor, and a DVD burner, fundamental questions are raised about identity and human-ness. Where <i>is</i> the soul of the machine? How many new components are necessary to make it a <i>new machine entirely?</i> Surely, Windows Activation can't be trusted to make this distinction.

I speculate that the soul is contained in the My Documents folder. And by that rule, with her files copied over from the old 30 gig drive to her new 120 gig drive, and a fresh install of XP professional humming along happily, I believe we can honestly say that it is still <i>her computer.</i> The fact that there are, truth be told, only <i>two parts</i> from her original machine still in use is inconsequential. They are <i>parts,</i> and that's what matters.

And, I mean, it has <i>lights</i> now. And <i>fans.</i> So many fans! My geeky heart is warmed.
