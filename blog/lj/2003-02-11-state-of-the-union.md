So I was depressed today.

It's something easy to say -- the words are all simple ones, and they're not particularly shocking. But what do they really mean, and how do they affect my life, my routine, my world?

It's nothing dramatic or cinematic really. Usually just a profound sense of tiredness -- with everything. A sense that the work necessary to make life happen (emotional work, physical work, intellectual work, the whole ball of wax) can't possibly be worth it. Worst case scenerios bubble up in the back of my psyche like a rolling boil. Sun seems ironic and clouds seem even worse. Lonliness grows at the edges of my thoughts like mold on old bread, and I start contemplating a future where every day feels this way. Where every moment is a conscious choice to keep putting one foot in front of the oether when all I want to do is close my eyes and sleep, and stop feeling anything for a long, long time. Sometimes it's easier to go through the motions when I feel this way -- routines are simple. Drive to work. Debug. Drive home. Pick up groceries. Sleep. Wake up. But people who know me know there's something missing. I know there's something missing.

The bigger question, though, is 'How do I deal with it?' I used to battle it out. Fight it. I'd come up with a new project to throw myself into, something that would spark my interest long enough to pull me out of the funk. I'd get an unrequitted crush on someone, something that could focus my emotional energy enough to snap me out of it. (Although that particular course was not quite successful in the long term, when it comes to staying happy. Heh.) Over the last few years, though, I think I've changed a lot. And the way I deal with depression has changed too.

I look at it like weather.

I am Jeff. My emotions are not, whether I like it or not, directly under my control. The things around me, the things inside me, and the things others do all affect them. In many ways, my emotions will fluctuate no matter what I do. Like the sun and rain and wind and snow, they come and go, happiness and sadness and excitement.

What I can do, regardless, is choose what actions I will take. I can choose to drive to the store for food even if the weather outside is miserable. I can choose to connect with a friend and encourage them even if I feel alone, and empty. I can choose to go to work and use my gifts and talents to help my employer even if it's bright and sunny outside and I want to play frisbee. I can choose to sit and listen to a friend who's hurting, even when I'm excited and want to talk about the latest ideas I'm tossing around.

I'm not sure if that makes any sense, really, but for me it's been a profound shift. I'm not controlled by my emotions, but I'm not denying them either. I understand that they're there. I experience them, and they do affect me. But I can still choose my own path. Sometimes there are hurricaines, and all I can do is batten down the hatches and ride out the winds. But, like all weather, even the dark storms pass. I guess this is what they mean by 'abiding.'
