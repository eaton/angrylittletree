uneventful, to say the least: alone at the office, i plowed through some updates for the kirkby site and put my nose to the proverbial NT grindstone. On the home front, Linux is starting to make more sense as I tinker and poke and prod further.  still, things like mounting removable disks can be positively bewildering. oi!

i'm infinitely fond of my christmas yo-yo, and am able to predictably zip the thing out, parallel to the ground, occasionally pulling off a horizontal sleeper. Round the worlds are always impressive, but alas... rocking the cradle eludes me.
