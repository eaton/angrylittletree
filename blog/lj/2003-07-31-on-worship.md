from a conversation elsewhere... we join it already in progress.

<blockquote><i>the worship that can be spoken of is not the eternal worship..?

i apologize if my statement seemed combative. i didn't intend it that way. i believe that your question, is a very good one.

what <i>will</i> we do if everyone is not singing the same way? we will worship.

early this year, i helped teach a series on worship in the small group that i am a part of. the conclusion of the series was something that we referred to as a "worship buffet." we took the large basement we normally meet in, shuffled the tables around, and made a few small islands. after a month of talking about the nature of worship, the reasons for it, and the heart that gives birth to it, we practiced it.

at one table, a few individuals read and contemplated. at another, three friends sat and journaled. at a third table, two budding artists took up easel and chalk to create a series of gorgeous drawings. a third person, lacking the refined skill but posessing the heart, carefully wrote the names of every person in the room on her shet of canvas, surrounded by the names of the fruits of the spirit. over by the couches, another handful of people prayed and sang together.

all of those people were worshiping, yet none of their actions were <i>worship.</i> it was the desire for god, the awe in the presence of his glory, and their attention focused on him that transformed their actions into worship.

though each of us was doing something different, we worshiped together. it was a corporate experience, rich with the knowledge that we were all taking that two hours on a busy weeknight to focus our spirits on him. together.

if every one of us had gathered over by the couches to sing, it would have been worship. if none of us had, it would have been worship.</i></blockquote>
