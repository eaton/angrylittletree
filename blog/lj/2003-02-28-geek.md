Benson: Question - do you have your laptop with you?  Does it have good battery life?
Benson: I have a spreadsheet that's relevant for tonite (as well as house pics) but that's contingent on finding a power outlet.
Verb: No copy of Excel, though, unfortunately. Only MS Word on my machine.
Benson: Maybe we can write a quick Excel parser in Java while everyone waits.
Verb: Surely there's a library...
Benson: A half-baked, unfinished, much-hyped open-source Java API?  What are the chances?
Verb: Nonsense. Everyone knows that open source costs nothing and ultimately reaches epsilon defects.
Benson: Because defect fixing can be massively parallel!  Right.
Verb: Eventually, fixing defects will *produce money* spontaneously. That's why M$ secretly hates open source -- massive hyperinflation caused by Open Source Money Creation would upset their monopolistic power.
