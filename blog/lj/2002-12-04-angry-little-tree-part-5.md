There once was a boy named Christopher. It's a good name, one I'm fond of. This boy, Christopher, wasn't a big child. Not a strong one. Runt of the litter you might say.

The bigger boys picked on him, as bigger boys do. Christopher knew they didn't *dislike* him. They had only just learned to pick on other children, and the novelty of it entertained them. It was a few years still, until they would know to hurt others with forethought.

Christopher, though he was small and not very strong, was not overly fond of being knocked down on the playground. He decided, then, that these bullies were simply bored. What they needed was adventure. Conflict!

And so, he scraped together his lunch money and bribed the biggest of the bullies. To follow him around and look intimidating to the other bullies. While some might consider this capitulation, it was but the first step in his grand plan.

Soon, other bullies attempted to pick fights with Christopher's bully. Rather than Christopher himself. Others, as it turns out, were more interested in helping out. Standing beside Christopher's bully on the battle lines that were slowly shaping up.

Christopher offered them a simple arrangement. Although he was certainly not in a position to put them on full time salary, any bullies interested in joining his organization were free to do so, provided they demonstrated good faith and did their best to work their way up through the ranks.

Bullies who didn't join were, naturally, a serious concern. Scuffling with them consumed most of the free time of Christopher's bullies.

As it turns out, the bullies were so busy trying to climb the ranks and keep The Outsiders from Sabotaging The Organization that they had no time left to push the other children down on the playground.

And Christopher, as it turns out, completed the second and third grades without further incident. As happy endings go, it's an uncomplicated one. But one always has to wonder what might've happened if he had chosen to unleash his unholy army of grade school bullies on the world.
