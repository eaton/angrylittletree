For ages I've been playing cool 3D first-person shooters. Games like Marathon, Quake, Untreal Tournament, and so on. Over the last couple years I've gotten deep into sim-oriented combat games. Shooters that emphasize good tactics, modern weapons, and squad cooperation over suicidal rocket-attacks and railgun sniping.

There's just something rewarding about syncronizing a three-man sweep through a jungle to take out a transmitter tower in Counterstrike, TacOps, or Infiltration that isn't present when you're just dashing around slinging ammo in Quake Deathmatches.

Naturally, news about a free FPS made by the US Army itself got those of us in the combat game community stoked. I mean, who better to make a game that emphasizes solid tactics, cooperation between teammates, and accurate simulation of weapons physics? Surely, the US Army can make a realistic game.

Unfortunately, they did.

Below are screenshots from my first evening of playing America's Army, v1.0.

In this picture, you can see my drill sergeant yelling at me because I fired before getting the All Clear on the practice range off in the distance.

In this picture, you can see me trying to pass the qualifying test for accuracy with the MA-16 rifle. It's in three round burst mode at the moment. That doesn't work too well for taking out popup targets. Surely, you say to yourself. I can just breeze through this part! Don't be so sure. Even if you qualify, you need to score as an <i>expert marksman</i> before they'll let you use the cool guns.

And this? This is the <i>obstacle course</i>. That's right. It's not enough to be accurate. It's not enough to put up with the shouting from the drill sergeant. You have to Run An Obstacle Course. I'd tell you about the rest of the game, but I keep falling off the rope nets on the other side of the wall, see...
