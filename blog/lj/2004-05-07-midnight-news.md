<i>... A technician points a speaker the size of a cereal box at someone standing 100 yards away. Amid the din of the nearby freeway, the technician plays a recording of ice cubes clinking into a glass. To the listener, the sound comes across as if it were through headphones, totally unlike a sound blaring from a distant speaker over oppressive car noise. Take two steps to the side, out of the sound beam, and you hear nothing at all. Step back in, and there it is again.</i>

So, apparently the recording industry has been sitting on fifty million dollars in unpaid royalties for piles of artists for quite a few years. The New York Attorney General has just completed a two year investigation, and things might be changing. The labels say they <i>lost the contact information</i> for the artists, and couldn't send the checks. Included on the list? Dolly Parton, David Bowie, and Dave Matthews. Uh-huh. Nice to see the labels are defending artists from the evil ravages of file sharing networks.

Courtesy <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a>, a short but sweet interview with Madeleine L'Engle, one of the Christian authors who's earned genuine respect inthe literary world. I hope I'm as simultaneously interesting and cumrudgeonly when I'm her age.

Interesting feature by the Times, detailing the sensitive roles that third-party military contractors are playing in Iraq and other fronts around the world. We've got about 20,000 of them in the Middle East right now, doing work that US troops used to do. One of the big problems is accountability -- in the wake of Abu Ghraib revelations, <i>nobody really knows who the contractors answer to.</i> <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> called this one a couple of weeks ago, before the abuse story broke. Looks like his gut was right.

A tremendously unsettling interview with the mother of Lynndie England, one of the soldiers photographed abusing Iraqi prisoners. <i>"They were just doing stupid kid things, pranks. And what the Iraqis do to our men and women are just? The rules of the Geneva Convention, do they apply to everybody or just us?"</i> Ignore the enormity of the denial.  Ignore the fact that most of the 30,000 prisoners moving through  Abu Ghraib are the civilians we're supposed to be liberating. What stands out to me is the fact that she's ignoring the primary rule of a "just war." <i>When you claim the moral high ground, you don't get to play the 'they commit atrocities, too' card.</i>

<i>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</i> is coming out June 25th. Turns out, it started life as an indie flick made on a Mac IIci.
