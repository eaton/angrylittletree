<a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/01/03/news/policy.html" target="_blank">The International Herald Tribune reports on President Bush's new announcement</a>:
<blockquote>President George W. Bush on Monday named his father and former President Bill Clinton to head a domestic fund-raising campaign to aid victims of the Asian tsunamis, in a move clearly meant to give a deeper U.S. imprint to a swelling international aid effort.
.
But after a week that saw some quiet griping about the initial aid levels from the United States and some others, Secretary of State Colin Powell said in Bangkok that he anticipated no additional increase in the $350 million in governmental aid for tsunami victims. "We haven't spent the money that we've committed," he said.</blockquote>

This is a good, good thing. As another blogger recently said, a diplomat <em>seeks</em> opportunities for diplomacy. The response to the tsunami has never been about raw numbers, but about conveying the sense of profound sadness for the losses, seriousness at the scope, and a genuine desire to help however possible.

The US <em>has</em> moved to help in ways sometimes more valuable than simple dollars. Heavy lift choppers are helping with relief efforts in areas where no vehicles can go. And putting respected ex-presidents from both sides of the political aisle at the helm of a visible, public fund raising campaign to help victims shows a willingness to help without tying it to one's own political party.

As someone who's often criticized Bush for various reasons and various decisions, and someone who criticized the spirit and letter of the President's initial response, I want to applaud both the spirit and letter of these recent announcements. I'm proud of them, as an American.
