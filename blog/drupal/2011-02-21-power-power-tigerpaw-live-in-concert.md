With the exception of chaotic prep for Drupalcon, this weekend was a nice breather from the impending launch of The Top Secret Project What Can't Be Named. It'll be nice to see it launch, both to get the deadline behind us and to see what public reaction to the site is. It feels good to have set up a client for future success, but but it's always tough to predict how bumpy the transition period will be.

I managed to catch a <a href="http://www.powerpowertigerpaw.com/">Power Power Tigerpaw</a> show at the Roundhouse on Sunday, which was a lot of fun. Jason, Danny and Mike have only just started to book shows, but they've been practicing like madmen for over a year. They are <em>ridiculously</em> tight. It's bombastic guitar-heavy rock with a lot of personality, and if you're reading this odds are you'll like it.

In unrelated but fun adult beverage news, I started the third round of test infusions. After the success of the holiday infusions at our Christmas party, I wanted to take a stab at some additional flavors. Currently cooking: blackberry, plum, and banana-vanilla vodka. I have high hopes...
