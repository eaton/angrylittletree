Both <a href="http://video.search.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> and <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google</a> have announced video search services this morning. So far, Google seems to be concentrating on indexing television shows and closed-caption text for easy retrieval. They're even cross-linking to Wikipedia articles. Yahoo, on the other hand, is trying to pull all those wacky video clips on the 'net into the land of proper searching. A quick search for <a href="http://video.search.yahoo.com/search/video?p=vanilla+ice">Vanilla Ice</a>, for example, yields viral video lips and outtakes from old music videos.
