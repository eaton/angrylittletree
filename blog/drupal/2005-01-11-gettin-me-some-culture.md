<blockquote>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</blockquote>

Thus begins <em>"Pride and Prejudice":amazon</em>, Catherine's exercise in educatin' me in the classics. I've dipped and dabbled in the tried and true works of western fiction, reading snippets here and there. But I'm a digital boy at heart and when it comes time to decide what I'll grab at the Borders checkout, it's hard to resist the lure of <em>the cutting edge.</em> Research on the psychology of divorce? Short stories about a world in which the Internet never happened? Investigative reporting about mercenary armies in African states? Graphic novels about life in Iran? Origami kits? There's so <em>much</em> out there, and the classics have been there for so <em>long</em>, waiting patiently like a mother with a scarf. Surely they'll be there later, won't they? Right?

But that's the sort of thinking that has left me ignorant of them for so long! It must stop. Or rather, it must <em>start</em>. Spurred on by <em>The Eyre Affair's</em> numerous references to <em>Jane Eyre</em>,  I requested a reading list from Catherine. I feel guilty! All I can offer her in return is a complete overview of pulpy scifi, cyberpunk, and the more polished literary offshoots. Even those still look like black sheep next to the Jane Austins and William Faulkners of the respectable establishment.

But so far, it's quite promising. Jane Austin, as I've always been assured, is quite the wit. I've already giggled several times. Three cheers for <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/pandp12.txt" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a>!

[Afternoon update: still amusing. Also, check out <a href="http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/pridprej.html" target="_blank">this interesting collection of notes </a>about the novel, Jane Austin's life, and the development of her writing.]
