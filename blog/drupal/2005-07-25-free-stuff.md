<blockquote>Peter Watts' success has been, shall we say, mixed. His first novel, <em>Starfish</em>, netted a "Notable Book of the Year" nod from the New York Times, an honorable mention for John W. Campbell Memorial Award, and rejections from both German and Russian publishing houses on the grounds that it was "too dark". (Being considered too dark for the Russians remains one of Watts's proudest accomplishments, although he remains puzzled by the translation of his book into Italian.) This also marked the beginning of a diffuse cult following of angst-ridden blogging teenaged girls who identified with Starfish's central character.</blockquote>

Amusing stuff on the bio page of writer/marine biologist Peter Watts. What makes it noteworthy? <a href="http://rifters.com/real/shorts.htm">He's released his two books, Starfish and Maelstrom, as free downloads under a Creative Commons license</a>. Writers like <a href="http://free-culture.org/freecontent/">Lawrence Lessig</a>, <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a>, and a <a href="http://wethemedia.oreilly.com/">number</a> of <a href="http://kembrew.com/books/">others</a> are starting to offer their back catalogs for free... Here's to a world where nothing goes out of "print."
