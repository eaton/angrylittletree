A new post about <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/blog/trouble_nodes">Node APIs and the current issues we face with them</a> is up on the Lullablog. I'm considering transitioning some of my geekier Drupal stuff over to the Lullabot Blog, to better separate my personal blogging and photo stuff from the hard-core geekiness of API proposals and other stuff like that. I might bring stuff back here in the future depending on how I feel about it; I think people only read this blog when I post stuff about Drupal APIs, I'm not sure I want to ditch <i>that</i> completely... ;)
