As fate would have it, as soon as I said that I wanted to post more frequently, I went and disappeared. I have a good excuse, though! I've been in Providence, RI with the rest of my coworkers from <a href="http://www.lullabot.com">Lullabot</a>. We're teaching a five day workshop on (what else?) Drupal. Monday and Tuesday, Angie Byron and I covered Drupal basics with about 25 people, and tomorrow Ted and Nate will be walking the same crowd through Drupal's theming system. <p align="left">It's a blast getting a chance to meet the rest of Lullabot in person. They're folks that I've worked with remotely for months now (and known via the net for much longer). Since we're scattered all over the world, it's rare to have a chance to get everyone together and we're all enjoying the time a lot.</p><p align="left">I am, though, a complete homebody. I'm enjoying the heck out of the workshop and my fellow bots, but it will be good to get back home and see my wife. It's been a year and a half since the wedding -- we're still allowed to be called newlyweds, right? Right? :-)</p>
