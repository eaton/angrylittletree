Last night after work I popped over to the Warehouse to get some shots of Jason's band, <a href="http://www.thesatellitepictureshow.com">The Satellite Picture Show</a>. They have a new drummer since they took their last patch of pics, so they needed some updated shots of the band playing. We took a couple of hours and got some nice ones; hopefully they'll work well for them. I posted a few of my favorites on Flickr...<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffeaton/127778310/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/52/127778310_62e121f9fe.jpg" width="450" alt="Stare Down" /></a><br/><!--break--><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffeaton/127778297/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/53/127778297_8ce0ffe12c.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Dan" /></a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffeaton/127778282/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/53/127778282_cc09782537.jpg" width="450" alt="Spinning" /></a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffeaton/127778149/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/55/127778149_b72f9625b1.jpg" width="450" height="333" alt="Full Band" /></a>
