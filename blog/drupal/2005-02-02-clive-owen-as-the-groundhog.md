A few nights ago, Catherine and I watched <em>Groundhogs Day</em>, one of Bill Murray's finest works of droll surrealism. For those who love that movie as much as I do, I present a beautiful tribute to the groundhog, by the PA board of tourism. This year, the groundhog's determined to get his shadow... and <em>nothing</em> will stand in his way.
