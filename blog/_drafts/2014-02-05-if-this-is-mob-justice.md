title: If This Is Mob Justice...

Dylan Farrow's recent op-ed in the New York Times Magazine reiterated decades-old charges that Woody Allen molested her when she was 7. Unsprisingly, this has promoted anger, outrage, and public bloviation. No small percentage of the rage has been directed at Dylan.

There's plenty of good writing that deals directly with her claims, their credibility, and the ugliness of the backlash that's being directed at her.  One objection in particular, though, smells a lot like the priveleged persecution complex I labored under for years. It's the idea that speaking out publicly against abusers or harassers is such a powerful act, so likely to trigger attacks against the accused, that it is *itself* tantamount to assault. Lynch mobs! Witch hunts!

That, frankly, is fucking bullshit.

## The Dreaded Matriarchy
The shape of this objection is rooted in the petulant rhetoric of the [Men's Rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_Rights) movement. It's a small but loud backlash against feminism, and its members insist that *women* hold all the power in society. Women, according to the most vocal MRAs, roam the world like wolves -- glibly sprinkling false rape accusations that destroy good mens' lives while facing no consequences for their own deceitfulness. When they're not concocting false rape stories or luxuriating in the warm embrace of the matriarchy, these women force men into lives of wage-earner slavery and deadly industrial work.

Needless to say, these guys *completely lose their shit* when a woman publicly accuses a man of sexual harassment or sexual assault. Such is their fear of trecherous women that any who makes such claims (and any who believe them) are immediately branded as The Enemy. The innocence of a man, they announce high-mindedly, must be presumed until a he is proven incontestably guilty -- not just in the courtroom, but in the minds and hearts of any who hear the accusations.

[The New Inquiry](http://thenewinquiry.com/blogs/zunguzungu/woody-allens-good-name/) deftly dismantles that line of thought, rightly pointing out that the burden of legal proof is there to protect the accused from *government punishment for legal tresspass*, not public ill will.

> Juries are empowered to say “We think the accused is probably guilty, but we’re not sure beyond a reasonable doubt, so we will not convict.” That bar is set high for a reason; if you’re going to lock a person in a cage for a long time, you need to be really sure. But we are also empowered to say the same thing, [and] because we are not in a court of law, we don’t even need to say the second part. The fact that we will not convict him doesn’t even need to be implied. He is not, after all, on trial.

## The Court of Public Opinion



I grew up deep in the heart of conservative, fundamentalist Christian political culture. Among other things, it means I'm intimately acquainted with the dynamics of communities blind to their own cultural privelege. Digging *myself* out of the that community's persecution complex was a hard but important part of my life, and it always startles me to see the same story playing out in other parts of our society.

To say that Christians are a dominant social and political force in the United States is a comical understatement. Self-professed Christians make up roughly 80% of the country's population, and over 90% of the seats in Congress. Christian holidays are *de facto* national holidays, Christian symbols litter our architecture and public discourse, and the faith's ubiquity is such that when "Religious groups" are mentioned in laws, many people have to be reminded that *Muslims and Jews and Hindus count, too.* Modern presidential races include effusive attempts by both candidates to prove their Jesus-loving bonafides, and atheists are -- literally! -- the least trusted social group in our nation.

And yet.



> If this is what Woody Allen’s career looks like, having been damaged so egregiously by spurious accusations that he is a child abuser, what precisely do you imagine an untainted Woody Allen career would look like? Dude gets his face on an officially minted piece of U.S. currency?
