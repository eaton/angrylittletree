title: Rock the Vote - Developing Voting, Rating, and Feedback Systems That Don't Suck
---

Introduction: an anecdote about what votes mean and what they should accomplish.

- Catherine's dinner question
- The Drupalcon session-rating fiasco, etc.

###The shape of the problem
Rating and Voting are two of the trickiest types of user-generated content.

- Well-intentioned people have biases
- Some people don't understand how to rate things
- Bad apples try to game the system
- Math and statistics are hard: GIGO and innumeracy can bite developers


###Pick your target
Why, why, why, why. If you don't understand what you're trying to accomplish, what pain you're trying to eliminate, it'll never work.

- Allocating a scarce resource (what goes on the front page)
- Explicit decision-making (vote to select the best X, elect a president)
- Crowdsourcing moderation/monitoring (unpublish flagged/poorly-rated content)
- Preventing expensive and disappointing user decisions (product rating/review)
- Exposing user sentiment ("I'm angry about this story!")
- Search augmentation/improving findability (Sort by quality/rating, products people-like-you also liked)

This section needs to be more focused.

###Pick your tool
To accomplish that, what do we have to gather? What happens as a result of the verbs, and what nouns are affected? How much friction is there? Should you expose data, or just use it to inform your presentation?

###The mathy part
- Average vs. Mean
- The IMDB rolling algorithm
- Slope 1 and friends
