title: When the Filter Bubble Bursts
---

- Evangelical Christian media subculture, to political subcultures, to content filtration and targeting. You can tailor your reality! See The Filter Bubble, The Information Diet, etc.
- subculture is like minded people talking about what they love. bubble is like minded people talking about the world outside the bubble.
- history of "othering" - elaine pegels concept of Satan as the original act of othering
- this happens automatically now. your google results are tailored, your facebook ads are targeted, your suggested twitter friends are adapted to what you recently looked at OUTSIDE OF twitter. explosion of media, online social spaces, etc means that even small subcultures can produce enough material to keep someone busy and insulated.
- this is rarely sustainable, though. either the subculture is invaded by outsiders who want access to the eyes/ears, the insiders escape because they want access to a larger audience, or lies the subculture tells itself about the outside world collide with reality.
- what does the crash look like?
  - evangelical music scene collapse
  - conservative media shock at romney loss
- how to combat it. personal steps include deliberate consumption of opposing ideas, shifting from "proof of correctness" to "search for accuracy"?
