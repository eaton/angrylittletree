The explosion of raw information in our culture has led to several significant challenges.

1. Writers, researchers, and thinkers have many tools to gather and organize "atoms" of information (links, photographs, statistics, papers written by others, etc). They also have many tools to create their own atomic units of information (word processors, presentation programs, etc). There are **very few tools that assist the interim process** -- sorting, organizing, notating, and adding speculative layers of metadata to the "raw materials" while the final knowledge-artifact is being created.
2. Information consumers, facing an explosion of contradictory information sources, increasingly rely on "filter bubbles" that confirm existing biases, and "ideological silos" that provide consistent facts and interpretation. Artifacts of knowledge that contradict these bubbles and silos are often ignored or discarded **even if the quality of the underlying thinking and research is excellent**, leading to a loss of knowledge.

We propose a toolchain to improve this situation using the following model:

1. Low-level "atoms" found during research
	* URLs (with cached content)
	* Media files
	* Queries to be executed against specific datasets (with cached results)
	* Existing knowledge artifacts like papers, presentations, etc.
	* Discussion threads
2. Layers of metadata added to atoms during the "digestion" process
	* Card sorts
	* Mind maps
	* Outlines
	* Verbal taxonomies
	* Diagrams and other organizing tools
	* Timelines
	* Relationships between atoms
	* Charts and visualizations
	* Notes and multi-participant discussions attached to atoms and groupings of atoms
3. Final products that synthesize the atomic elements
	* Books
	* Research papers
	* Presentations

This 'repository' of knowledge should be versioned, so that all changes, additions, and alterations can be reviewed as a historical record of the evolution of a given knowledge artifact. Using a git-like system, this would: allow individuals or teams to share their underlying research for "forking;" allow fact-checkers to verify underlying research methodology for assertions made in news articles; allow interested parties to learn from by backtracking through the development process; allow arbitrary third-party tools to assist at any stage just as development tools can be used to manipulate source code when working towards a software "release."
