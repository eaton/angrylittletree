title:Finding, Filtering, and the Real Curation Revolution

Digging through old boxes, I came across a worn keepsake from one of the first conference sessions I ever delivered. At the 1996 [Write To Publish](http://www.writetopublish.com/) conference, I put together a Q&A-oriented presentation entitled *Researching On The Internet*. Looking over the handout I created for it is interesting for a couple of reasons.

First, it appears I've always loved Officina Sans and there's no use fighting it. At least I had good taste in fonts back then, having gotten the worst sins out of my system during the heady days of dekstop publishing.

Second, it was really hard to figure out exactly *when* I wrote the handout. I know the presentation took place in the mid-90s, but nailing down the exact year required some archaeology. Turns out, the URL I gave for Project Bartleby was the one it had used as a skunkworks student project -- in early 1997, [it moved to its current URL at bartleby.com](http://bartleby.com). On the other side, HistoryChannel.com launched in October of 1995 and the WTP conference takes place in the summer. By process of elimination, the handout must've been from June or July of 1996.

Third, *holy shit.* There are kids driving around in their own cars who are younger than that handout, and they've grown up with a thoroughly indexed, monetized, business-driven Internet. The frozen-in-amber view that handout provides is from the days when web sites on the Internet was were numbered in the thousands, "indexes" like Yahoo had yet to be eclipsed by automated search engines, and the content explosion was only just beginning. The era of dial-up services was ending, businesses were scrambling to set up Home Pages, and the work of moving difficult-to-access information archives to the web was beginning to ramp up.

###Cycles of Curation

One of the striking things about the Internet of the mid 90s is its reliance on individual curators to gather, assemble, and contextualize useful information.
