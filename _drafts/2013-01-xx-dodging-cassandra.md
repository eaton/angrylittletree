Cassandra is the Mad Prophetess of Troy, able to hear the future but cursed to never be believed. When Greek soldiers laying siege to Troy mysteriously disappear, leaving a gigantic wooden horse behind, the city celebrates because obviously it means THEIR AWESOMENESS scared off the Greeks! Cassandra warns them that it's a deadly trap, that they'll all be killed, and that she'll be killed -- but no one listens.

SPOILER: THE HORSE IS FULL OF GREEKS

If you've ever been the software developer, engineer, technical pm, or otherwise responsible person in the room for the joyous optimism of a new project's first planning session, you probably know how Cassandra felt. You're looking at bad omens, tingling spidey-senses, and all kinds of signs that you're in for a bumpy ride -- but everyone else is nodding and saying, "Let's crush this!"

Being worried is never enough. "Documenting concerns" is CYA, and while it can give legal protection it doesn't make the project SUCCEED. Cassandra is right, but she dies. There is no joy in "I told you so" when your team is suffering.

[ Should these 5 points be things-to-do or things-to-identify? action or target statements? ]

1. Make the uncertainties explicit (spec, timeline, scope, new/unfamiliar/immature tech, acceptance criteria)
2. Compare to past projects (disparity of estimate vs actual is critical)
3. Identify deep dependency chains and in the technology and the teams (these multiply the effects of uncertainty)
4. Identify fuzzy authority roles (are there four people who have to sign off? who says it's done?)
5. Time box and prototype: get engaged before you get married (if there's uncertainty, plan to build and test, and explain the stakes of the results)

The goal of these things is twofold: solve real problems before they explode, or make the pitfalls so clear and unambiguous that they are simply realities that must be acknowledged. Gut checks, on a mature team under ideal circumstances, CAN be enough, but there are always times when something more concrete is necessary.
