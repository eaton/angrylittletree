Occasionally, when it comes to playing the Six Degrees game, I'll pull out a fun trivia tidbit. I'm only three degrees away from Mobutu Sese Seko, the former dictator of Zaire. Via, of course, <a href="http://www.skeptictank.org/robem2.htm">Pat Robertson.</a>



It's good for a chuckle -- albeit a nervous one -- but it's true. Many many moons ago (think the 80s), I published a zine. I did this before I'd ever heard of a zine, and thought it was just called a <i>publication</i> or perhaps <i>a news magazine</i>. It involved lots of work with paste-up boards and an old daisy-wheel printer, scamming interviews with interesting people, and convincing publishers to send me 'review copies' of books. What a life!



Eventually, the 'Awww, kid publishes magazine! How cute!' angle got some publicity and there were about 300 or so subscribers around the country. At its peak, I was asked to co-host an episode of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_700_Club">The 700 Club,</a> a well-known Christian news/talk show hosted by now-infamous Christian televangelist and political personality Pat Robertson. Pat wasn't there that day (alas -- I'd only be TWO degrees from Mr. Seko) but the results are still... curious.



Now, thanks to the wonder of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3769631641280458858">Google Video</a>, you can witness it, too. Hilights include me with a scarily fluffy mullet, news clips about Michael Gorbachev's new vice president, the awkward interrogation of a black child on live television, and The World's Most Morbid Interview Ever.

Bonus! For the truly curious, my childhood encounter with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zrVIEiEn3A">bodybuilder Jake Steinfield</a>. Don't Quit!
