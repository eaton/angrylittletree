Quite a while ago, Dark Horse Comics rolled out the first few chapters of a faithful graphic novel adaptation of HG Wells' War of the Worlds. I haven't been keeping track, but it's finished now and will soon be availlable in a nicely bound hardcover edition. They've kept the online version intact, though, along with a spiffy collection of downloadable goodies. I think I'll always prefer Alan Moore's version, nestled into a six-issue story arc for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but this version is prettty cool.
