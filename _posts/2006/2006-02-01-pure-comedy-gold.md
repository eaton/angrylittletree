<strong>UPDATE: No corroborating articles have come around to back up KR's original piece on this subject, quoted at the bottom of this post. PulpSpy posts a link back to the original press conference for more context on the 'only an example' comment, and notes that it's not quite the backpedal that it appeared to be from the article. Here's hoping that someone in the Administration is serious about energy independence. I'm skeptical as all hell, but hope springs eternal.</strong>



After last night's State of the Union, I was startled to find that the President pledged to dramatically cut our fossil fuel usage over the next two decades. It's the sort of bold leap that i've been saying we need to take to maintain our nation's current rayte of growth and standard of living -- weaning our nation off petrolium would be no less important than the space race was in the 1960s.



Of course, I was rather skeptical. The Bush administration has spent the last six years or so seeking out promising energy initiatives and strangling them in their cribs, so I was a little perplexed. Today, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4672216.stm">he went out stumping and gave some details.</a>

<blockquote>On Wednesday President Bush set off on a tour of the United States to bring the messages in his State of the Union speech to all corners of the nation.



He told the Nashville audience that the US was close to a breakthrough in making ethanol from materials like grasses or woods.



"All of a sudden, you know, we may be in the energy business by being able to grow grass on the ranch! And have it harvested and converted into energy. That's what's close to happening," he said.</blockquote>



I've ranted about Ethanol before; it's pork, pure and simple. The same problems we face with oil will be faced with Ethanol: even converting the entire midwest into a giant expanse of corn, dedicated to nothing but biomass production, wouldn't give us enough raw material to offset our fossil fuel usage.



Don't worry, though -- <a href="http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/news/nation/13767738.htm?source=rss&channel=krwashington_nation">the President didn't really mean it.</a>

<blockquote>One day after President Bush vowed to reduce America's dependence on Middle East oil by cutting imports from there 75 percent by 2025, his energy secretary and national economic adviser said Wednesday that the president didn't mean it literally.

...

Bush vowed to fund research into better batteries for hybrid vehicles and more production of the alternative fuel ethanol, setting a lofty goal of replacing "more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025."



He pledged to "move beyond a petroleum-based economy and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past."



Not exactly, though, it turns out.



"This was purely an example," Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said.

...

Asked why the president used the words "the Middle East" when he didn't really mean them, one administration official said Bush wanted to dramatize the issue in a way that "every American sitting out there listening to the speech understands."</blockquote>



Uh-huh. Well, at least we've reduced the turnaround time on the backpedaling to twenty-four hours now. According to last year's State of the Union, we should still be gunning for a manned mission to Mars right about now. Maybe next year we'll get ponies for everyone.
