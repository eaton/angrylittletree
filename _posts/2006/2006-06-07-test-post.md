I'm testing <a href="http://drupal.org/node/38178">a patch to Drupal's blogapi.module</a>. If this goes through, things are working fine. Yay!



(Update: The patch in question would allow other modules, like trackback, to participate in processing a blogapi submission. Intelligent handling of MovableType teaser and excerpt fields, for example, could be handled by a custom module. A livejournal_post content type could pull in the mood and current song fields, rather than discarding them. If you're a drupal developer, pop over to the patch's issue and cast your vote. Woo...)
