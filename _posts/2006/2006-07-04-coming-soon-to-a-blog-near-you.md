Well. It's certainly been a nice Fourth of July. My old buddy <a href="http://www.chuck-pearson.org/blog">Chuck Pearson</a> was in town for Cornerstone, and we got a chance to have lunch and talk for a few hours. He's one of the folks I met on the net years and years ago, and knew he was my kind of guy. It was a real treat to see him in person again. Another old friend, Becky Trost, swung through just an hour later and we caught up before she buzzed out of town. And after all of that, Catherine and I had our families over for dessert and a movie. An action-packed, fun-filled time was had by all. Yar. Yar, I say.



I've been a little slow on the blogging lately, due to that fun combination of work and side projects. More than anything, though, I've been tinkering with some ways to re-organize things here. More specifically, I'm looking at how to make myself a full-fledged site with a blog <i>section</i> rather than a plain old livejournal on steroids.



Further updates as events warrant...
