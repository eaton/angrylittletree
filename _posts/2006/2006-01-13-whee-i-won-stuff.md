Well. I've definitely been out of circulation for a while as far as the blog is concerned. It's been a busy couple of weeks (of course!) and I've been tinkering with more Drupal code to get some of the old features from ViaPositiva back online (like amazon reviews of books I've read or movies Cat and I have watched).



In the meantime, though, I switched to a new search engine on a whim. http://www.blingo.com is just a front end to Google's search results, so there's not much to learn. The nice bit is that they give away free movie tickets and iTunes gift cards at random. I signed up earlier this week, and this morning while googling for some code snippets, I won. Wahoo!
