<a href="http://jeff.viapositiva.net/files/cd_envelope.pdf"><img src="/files/cd_envelope.png" align="left" hspace="5" border="0"></a>After all the Drupal stuff, I figure it's time for a change of pace. I'm in the process of cleaning off my old hard drive and setting up a spiffy now 400 gig drive. That means happy discoveries as I trudge through folders full of years-old "I'll get to that later" files.



One of the ones I came across tonight is a spiffy little printable template I made one evening when I needed an envelope for a mix CD I'd made for a friend. Just cut on the thick dotted line, fold the four flaps in on each other, and glue or tape the thin flaps to the main 'backing' of the envelope. Cut a slit on the light grey line if you want to tuck in the envelope's "flap."
