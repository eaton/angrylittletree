For many years, I've heard rumors of the infamous <i>Star Wars Christmas Special.</i> It went straight to television in 1978, just a year after the explosive debut of the first Star Wars movie. It's spoken of in sad, hushed tones -- like a little-mentioned brother that died trying to juggle power drills.



Jason and Steph have a copy of it, thanks to a hardcore geek friend of ours, but I've never gotten around to watching it. Thanks to the magic of the Internet, though, <a href="http://www.pistolwimp.com/media/42214/">it's now available for viewing on YouTube.</a> Naturally, I clicked.



Just two minutes in, I can see that the rumors were true. It is not, in fact, a terrible Droids-esque cartoon. It is a live action drama starring all the original actors! This isn't the respectable art-film sort of train wreck. It's the bury-the-footage, pretend-it-never-happened cut-it-from-the-continuity sort of trainwreck that only happens when words like <i>contractual obligation</i> and <i>thirty kilos of mescaline</i> are involved.



It's a Christmas Special. It's Star Wars. And Chewbacca has a wife named <i>Paula.</i> This one's a keeper.



<b>Edit: Five minutes in, now.</b> The opening scene is a cozy domestic act, with Paula tidying up the house and pining for Chewbacca's return. Their son Lumpy and his grandfather Itchy -- yes, Lumpy and Itchy -- scuffle playfully. What's wrong with this picture? They're all wookies, and none of them speak english. It's like Leave It To Beaver meets the first twenty minutes of 2001...



<b>Edit: Ten minutes.</b> Mark Hamil. Art Carney. R2D2. Paula the wookie preparing dinner while watching a purple, four-armed Martha Stewart alien on television. Slapstick comedy. Camera cuts away to a tie fighter battle. Hello!



<b>Edit: Fifteen minutes.</b> Art Carney just gave Itchy the wookie LSD-influenced holo-porn as a LifeDay gift. Sample quote: "You... are my fantasy!" Cue suggestive wookie growling. Cut back to the holo-fantasy... singing a wookie lounge song! The goggles, they do nothing!



<b>Edit: Fifteen minutes, thirty seconds.</b> More tie-fighters. Chewie and Han are running a blockade.



<b>Edit: Sixteen minutes.</b>Uhoh. Storm troopers everywhere at wookie home! The tidy domestic scene is threatened. They're searching the house, and asking questions... A stormtrooper opens a device of some sort, and... Jefferson Airplane appears. In the middle of a giant purple kaliedescope. Playing a ballad. What... The...



<b>Edit: Eighteen minutes.</b> Cartoon interlude! Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher look like extras from Aeon Flux! Fistfight with Boba Fett! He's riding a sea monster!



<b>Edit: Twenty-two minutes.</b> Bea Arthur is a bartender as Mos Eisley Cantina. And a lounge singer. This isn't happening to me. Dear God, this isn't happening to me.
