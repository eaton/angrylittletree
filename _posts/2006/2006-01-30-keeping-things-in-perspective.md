<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aRZrMqeQXaVc&refer=us">Bloomberg covers the president's upcoming State of the Union address.</a> In it, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama offers some fascinating commentary:

<blockquote>"When Bush is focused, he can give candidates a big boost," [Sessions] says. "<i>Hurricane Katrina hit him hard and it got him off-message.</i> But he can still draw a crowd, he's good on the stump and he can re-energize the coalition that got him 51 percent of the vote" in 2004.</blockquote>

With all due respect (I know politicking is hard work), I don't really think that <i>the President</i> was the one hit hard by Katrina.
