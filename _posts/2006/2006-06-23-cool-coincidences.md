While skimming over the discussion forums at Drupal.org, I stumbled across <a href="http://drupal.org/node/69125">a message by a new user</a> about some problems uninstalling modules. It turned out the problems were related to my own baby, VotingAPI, and I stuck around to help the guy through some of the configuration hassles.



As it turns out, he's a photographer with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/jyoseph/">a great set of images on flickr</a>, and a <a href="http://www.jyoseph.com/photoblog/">photoblog</a> with some impressive do-it-yourself projects like a homemade light ring and a quick-n'-dirty lightbox. Yesterday evening, I put together the lightbox and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffeaton/tags/macro/">tried my hand at some photos with it</a>. Awesome! With just $10 in white foamcore and a few reflector lights from Home Depot, I've got a super-bright space for taking macro shots.



Thanks, jyoseph!
