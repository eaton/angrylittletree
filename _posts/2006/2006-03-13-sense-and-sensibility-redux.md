Awwww yeah. On the heels of the disastrously bad Hollywooding of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, British screenwriter Andrew Davies is going to take a crack at <i>Sense and Sensibility.</i> Davies is the guy who wrote the amazing BBC miniseries version of P&P, and my Austen-loving heart is all aflutter at the news of his latest project. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4311734.stm">BBC News has the skinny:</a>

<blockquote>

He rejected the idea that Austen had been overexposed in the last decade after Pride and Prejudice sparked a craze for Austen dramas.



"You can cut Jane Austen so many ways and I think people still want to return to them," he said. "Who wants to see all these action movies all the time?



"There is a different audience out there apart from 12- to 14-year-old boys and I think a lot of the stories that people like to see now were written in the 19th Century or before. </blockquote>

I suppose it <i>is</i> still a good time to be a Jane Austen fan.
