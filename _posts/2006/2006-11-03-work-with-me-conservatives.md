"That preacher keeps talking about how homosexuality is wrong -- he's probably closeted." I've always found that kind of reasoning annoying. It's no different, really, than the "Atheists wouldn't be annoyed by religion if they didn't secretly know we're right" meme trotted out by embryonic apologists. It presumes that any speaker's strong expression of belief is secretly motivated by a guilty secret. It's a silly, circular trap that's fun for rhetorical jabs but useless for real thought.



But seriously, Conservatives have been making this WAY harder than they should be these days. Between Congressman Foley and <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_4588998">Evangelical WunderPastor</a> <a href="http://www.kktv.com/news/headlines/4557411.html">Ted Haggard</a>, the data points are starting to accumulate. You're not helping me with this 'opposing stupid rhetorical tricks' campaign I'm on. It's like trying to explain the problems with straw-man attacks only to have the other debate participant admit, "Well, actually I <i>DO</i> eat puppies, and my plans WOULD lead to the destruction of life as we know it..."



So, if you're going to fight against gay marriage day in and day out, y'know... Please try to avoid the hot man lovin'. Work with me, Conservatives. Please?
