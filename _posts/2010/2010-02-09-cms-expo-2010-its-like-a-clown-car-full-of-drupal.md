Last year I had the privilege of speaking at the Chicago CMS Expo, a yearly event that brings together experts from a variety of open source communities for learning and collaboration. In 2009, Joomla!, Drupal, and Plone folks had some great training and education tracks as well as interesting business sessions for the suits.

I'll be there in May along with Larry Garfield and Colleen Carrol of Palantir; Emma Jane Hobgin, co-author of <em>Front End Drupal</em>; Doug Vann and Matthew Lechleider; and Volacci's Ben Finklea. I've also heard a few <em>rumors</em> that a big name in the Drupal universe will be talking about the future direction of the platform... The list is pretty impressive and I'm looking forward to connecting, teaching, and hanging out with folks from various CMS communities.



If you're in the area and are interested in kicking various platforms' tires, it's one of the few events where you can hear experts from <em>several</em> CMS communities, rather than a few token visitors at an event dominated by one product. In addition, CMS Expo's banners are a pleasant, soothing shade of aqua. <a href="http://j.mp/cmsexpo">Check it out!</a>
