My life at this point is basically a nonstop firehose of Skype calls, delicious links, SSH logins, and googlefests culminating in presentations in strange office parks. I <em>live</em> in the cloud. My music, my photos, my todo lists, my notes, my travel arrangements, my Christmas list, and my pants size are just chilling out there in a distributed fluff of XML. So, yeah, on that level the iPad with a copy of Keynote for presenting and a bluetooth keyboard for server wrangling sounds like the best thing since ever.



On the other hand, I strongly believe that people who write paragraphs like the one I just wrote should be punched in the junk, over and over, until they buy potable water for a village somewhere.



So, conflicted.
