<strong>0:00</strong> - Welcome to the movie 'Doubt!' It's lookin' like the 50s or 60s. Drama took a while to get moving in those days.



<strong>2:30</strong> - Kids playing outside. Uhoh. Kid mentions to his neighbor that he's an altar boy. Totally different implication now.



<strong>5:00</strong> - And... our first Phillips Seymour Hoffman sighting! He's preaching about the Kennedy Assasination, a nice timecheck. He's talking to people about isolation and loneliness and doubt. It is a suspiciously Willow-esque sermon.



<strong>7:30</strong> - We have our first nun head-smack! Meryl Streep, keepin' the kids in line. Priest says, "Doubt can be as powerful and sustaining a bond as certainty: when you are lost, you are not alone." Nun looks unhappy. Dun-dun-DUNNNNN. She probably didn't like Blue Like Jazz, either. 



<strong>9:00</strong> - Kid confides in Father whats-his-name that he wants to be a priest. Kid and priest share a quiet moment of friendly interaction. Priest gives the kid a present. OH GOD MOLESTOR



<strong>10:00</strong> - Innocent nun-caught-in-the-middle. In our first scene with her, she's waking up in the middle of the night. Clearly something is weighing on her.



<strong>10:01</strong> - Or not? Nuns just wake up really early all the time, I guess.



She's a teacher! Totally looks like a wet-behind-the ears newb nun, and the kids are acting up in class. Maryl Streep nun walks in, and they snap to attention and stand up. I'll bet she chooses one to publicly kill each year. She grabs a kid who was listening to a radio, drags him out. Everyone looks nervous, like Zebras trying not to talk about the lion that just took Ned.



<strong>15:00</strong> - Nuns! Eating dinner! It is a very quiet dinner.



<strong>17:00</strong> - Dinner with nuns, still very quiet. OH CRAP maryl streep is ringing a bell. Asks the other nuns what THEY think the sermon about 'doubt' was about. Conclusion: she is a hardass. Or she totally knows he's a child molester.



<strong>20:00</strong> - Meryl Streep is the House of the nunnery. "William London would set his FOOT on fire to escape half a day of school," she says of one student Takes the newb nun under her wings, explains how things work. "You are responsible to ME. I am responsible to the mon signor, and the bishop, up to the holy father." Throws away the newb nun's box of cough drops (they're <em>like candy!</em>). She points disapprovingly at a ballpoint pen. "Penmanship is DYING across this country!"



God, this is like listening to Andy Rooney.



<strong>24:00</strong> - Uhoh. Father seymour is teaching kids basketball. Stops the game, starts lecturing kids on cleanliness and not having dirty nails. God, the creepyness. "Look, my nails are long, but I keep them clean. I like 'em long. But that makes it okay." Ooooooookay. You just go like it long, man.



There are strange weird subtexts as the kid who wants to talk to the father gives the priest glances and searching looks. Donald, his name is. "Donald, please go to the rectory."



<strong>28:00</strong> - OH SHIT NEWB NUN SNOOPING IN THE PRIEST'S LOCKER. I... wait, what? OOooh. I see. Newb nun saw priest snooping in a KID'S locker, then snooped in in it. Which means... Ah, geeze. Priest sniffing kids' shirts. This is like Livejournal.



<strong>30:00</strong> - "This parish serves irish and italian families," says the old nun. "Someone will hit Donald."



"Donald... has a protector. Father Flynn." Maryl streep pauses. Ice fills the air. "He's taken an interest."



Ominous music. Maryl Streep's eyes go cold.



<strong>33:00</strong> - Father Flynn chatting comfortably with the kids. They're having milk and cookies and he's talking to them about girls. Catherine: "HIS NAILS ARE SO CREEPY."



<strong>36:00</strong> - Conspiracy of nuns: A CHALLENGER ARRIVES. I'm ... creeped out by the vibe of the nuns all knowing without saying it that they have to keep an eye out for pedophile priests.



<strong>42:00</strong> - Nuns-and-priest conference. Christmas conference being discussed. "Frosty the snowman espouses a belief in PAGAN MAGIC. I... may I ask what you're writing down with that ballpoint pen?" The glove is being thrown down. Battle of the wills. Father Flynn is talking about how the church 'needs to change.' Maybe sing some songs from the radio. Be friendlier. TAKE THE BOYS ON A CAMPING TRIP OH GOD MOLESTER



<strong>45:00</strong> - she manuevers the conversation to Donald Miller as she manages to maneuver the father back around the other side of her desk. She's adjusting blinds, putting the sun in his eyes. God, it's like police interrogation.



Father Flynn is being shifty. A telephone is ringing. Meryl Streep doesn't answer it. "I object to your tone," he says. "This isn't about your tone. I want to know WHAT HAPPENED IN THE RECTORY."



The ambiguity of it is fascinating: clearly two carefully constructed narratives, one in which a new and (relatively) liberal priest engages with his congregation and his students and faces attacks from suspicious traditionalists... or, alternately... oldschool nun who cares, trying to outsmart a predator.



<strong>53:00</strong> - "You honestly find this school to be run like a prison?" "Well, no. But. All the students are uniformly terrified of you." "Yes. That's the way it works."



<strong>54:00</strong> - Father Flynn preaches a sermon about gossiping. Oh, way to use the bully pulpit. Streep watches from her pew, steely-eyed. Newb looks tormented.



<strong>57:00</strong> - Pastor Flynn talks to newb nun. She doesn't trust him. He's extending an olive branch -- OR trying to drive the wedge between her and the hardass nun. Argh, the drama!



<strong>60:00</strong> - First encounter with Donald since these revelations. Outside class, in class. The kid seems tormented. Now Donald's mother appears at the school to talk to the nun. She's a very smart, canny operator. And she's slowly, carefully, trying to build a case against Father Flynn. Every facial tic, every weighted pause, feels like a clue in an unfolding murder mystery.



Nun tells mom she's concerned about the relationship between Father Flynn and Donald. "He may have made advances on your son." Oh God. The dominos start falling.



"I know I am RIGHT." Ai yi yi.



<strong>75:00</strong> - Oh god. Fuck. This is bad.



<strong>77:00</strong> - Hey, look, it's the murderer at the door, and the nun won't lie!



<strong>80:00</strong> - "You will tell me what you have done!"



<strong>85:00</strong> - And see, this is why I don't like the sacrament of confession. It's like the metafilter thread all over again!
