<li><strong>No Heroics</strong> is low-budget a British sitcom about fucked-up, schleppy C-list superheros. It's a mutant hybrid of Coupling, Mystery Men, and Cheers; episodes consist mostly of The Heatness, Timebomb, Girl Power, and Electroclash kvetching over beers at the superheros-only pub. It's crass, tasteless, and the timing is solid so far; definitely worth a torrent if you're here in the US.

</li><li><strong><a href="http://chicago.metromix.com/restaurants/contemporary/nosh-geneva/137860/content">Nosh,</a></strong> an awesome local gem in downtown Geneva. It's a breakfast/brunch place with a serious bent toward foodie-style quirkiness. Catherine and I made it out for a nice brunch this morning, and I died for the Red Eye Benedict: two poached eggs on english muffins with coffee-encrusted flatiron steak, covered in shiitake hollandaise. Gorgeous fresh sliced pears on the side. I'm drooling just remembering it.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</a></strong> has awesome content, but it's always been plagued by by nasty javascript that popped up word definitions whenever I double-clicked on text in its articles. Today, they rolled out a new version of the script that makes tooltip-style icons over words rather than firing up windows automatically. It's stupid and silly, but man. My Times reading experience is so much nicer. Woo!

<li><strong><a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com">FiveThirtyEight</a></strong> feeds my need for election nerdpr0n. It's a polling stats wonk site, and crunches serious numbers from all the national and local polls being conducted over the course of the 2008 race.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.blizzard.com/us/war3/">Warcraft III.</a></strong> Nate is to blame for this one, but slowly I'm getting better at skirmishes. My old go-to tactic from Age of Empire II -- slowly build up an overwhelming force in secret, then clobber the opposition -- was getting me mulched on a regular basis.

<li><strong><a href="http://www.franziskaner.com/">Franziskaner,</a></strong> possibly the yummiest 'everyday' beer in the universe. It's light and very smooth, with a fruity taste that doesn't bite. It's super-delicious.</li>

Further updates as awesomeness warrants.
