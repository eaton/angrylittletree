Never let it be said that MetaFilter doesn't deliver. One link, one title: <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/76238/Live-webcam-of-a-box-full-of-puppies">BOX FULL OF PUPPIES WEBCAM.</a>



This is totally my go-to site until polls close. I've got it on the living room TV right now so Catherine and I can just look over and watch them scuffle. Right now the one with the green collar seems to be chewing on Red's head. It's a thug puppy life.
