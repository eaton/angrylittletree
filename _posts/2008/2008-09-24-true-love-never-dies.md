I got my start as a "computer professional" in the world of desktop publishing, not computer programming. When I was younger, I wrote and I made <a href="http://jeff.viapositiva.net/old/kidstuff/">a zine</a> and (naturally) as I learned a bit more about the rules of design, I tried to pick up work doing heavy labor in Pagemaker, Quark, and Illustrator.



I spent several years working for a small marketing company, doing basic design and layout work, writing copy for clients who had a business but didn't know how to describe it, and -- eventually -- tinkering with HTML when the company tried to take the plunge into New Media in the mid 90s. A decade of crazy twists and turns later, I'm a straight-up software developer who's years removed from any real design work. I never stopped loving good type, though.



I'll never claim to be a typographer... Maybe a type aficionado? In any case, I think every once in a while I'll be posting one of my favorite faces here, just because. Tonight, it's <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=433325">Bodoni.</a> It's always seemed very dignified to me: classy and direct without being stuffy. What do you think?
