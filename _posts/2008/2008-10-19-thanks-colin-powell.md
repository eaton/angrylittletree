Given the current climate, I'm not sure that Colin Powell's resounding endorsement of Barack Obama for President will have much impact on the race. Among antiwar liberals and many people outside the US, Powell's doomed UN appearance in support of the Iraq invasion really shredded his reputation. On the flip side, his halfhearted support for the post-invasion stupid parade doomed his chances of being a conservative/neocon icon.



Today, though, his eloquent statements for the press hit on an issue that goes deeper than who wins or loses the race:

<blockquote>[They say] "Well, you know that Mr. Obama is a Muslim." Well, the correct answer is, he is not a Muslim, he's a Christian. He's always been a Christian.



But the really right answer is, <em>what if he is?</em> Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America. Is there something wrong with some seven-year-old Muslim-American kid believing that he or she could be president? ....<em>This is not the way we should be doing it in America.</em></blockquote>

The accusations and denials that have revolved around Obama's supposed Muslim affiliations have all accepted the premise that to be <em>Muslim</em> is to be <em>unamerican</em>. This is the kind of thinking that the United States has always demonstrated a regrettable weakness for. In the 1960s, JFK had to assure voters repeatedly that his <em>Catholic</em> faith wouldn't prevent him from acting in the nation's best interests. Curiously, white Protestants never seem to face the same question.



Powell's statements are a breath of fresh air: it's a shame that more high-profile figures haven't stepped up to say the same thing.
