This month, a few of the <a href="http://www.lullabot.com">Lullabots</a> (myself included) have been working on one of our rare development projects. Most of our work is training, architecture, and workshop oriented stuff, but every once in a while a client that we've been working with has a last-minute need for some ninjas and we put our heads together for some custom coding work.

While short, it was definitely an interesting project and one that I think might be a first for Drupal. When the site goes live I'll have to point it out; the <a href="http://www.treehouseagency.com">Treehouse Agency</a> team is doing some great theming work for the site, and I'm curious to see how it all turns out. We built the site in phases, and created a set of custom module-managed tpl.php files for them to customize. It's the first project that's involved a hand-off like that, and Drupal 6's templating made it quite a bit easier. I'm looking forward to kicking around ideas with them about how that transition can be smoothed even more.

<a href="http://www.walkah.net">James</a> and <a href="http://rocktreesky.com/">Addi</a> and I hustled out to Penn State last week to give a cool group of educators the Drupal intensive boot camp. CCK, Views, theming... they ate it up and we were really impressed with how much they absorbed in a short stretch of time. On the downside, Addi was hit with the flu and James and I ended up stranded by flight delays... but we're safe and sound now, so all is (pretty) well.

And now? The holidays are sneaking up on us all, and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jeffeaton/3035398829/">Catherine</a> and I celebrated preemptively with a nice dinner dinner and... well... An X-Box 360. We've been eying one for a while, and the sudden appearance of Fallout 3 was the tipping point. She's got Assassin's Creed and I'm making my way through the post-apocalyptic wastelands with my trusty Pip-Boy 3000... I don't think I will <em>ever</em> go through the hassle of building a gaming PC again. Having things just work is <em>awesome.</em>
