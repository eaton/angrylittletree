If there's one thing I can't stand, it's things not being <em>perfect</em>. Obviously, that's a problem when it comes to blogging. Instead of writing a post, I stare accusingly at my blog and ask it why it can't integrate cleanly with Unfuddle.com's APIs, or announce new posts on Twitter, or auto-import delicious links that I tag with 'blogthis'.



Most people get over that kind of thing quickly, but since my blog runs Drupal, and I have been known to occasionally tinker with Drupal, it turns into an epic struggle to wrestle awesome from the jaws of merely-cool. I ignore the actual writing of posts and start spinning off modules, and tinkering with markov chainers, and, and... Yeah.



I made it halfway this time: after a stupidly long hiatus, I've migrated both my blog and Catherine's to the new version of Drupal, polished up a new theme for myself, and snuck in some nifty bits like Twitter integration. The edges are still mighty rough, but I promised myself I wouldn't wait until things were perfect. Slowly but surely, I return to the land of the blogging!
