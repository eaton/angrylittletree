Going into the office on a Saturday sucks. Going in for a mandatory meeting <em>really</em> sucks. Going in for a mandatory meeting and being told that you won't be allowed to leave? That's extra special suck.



But when your boss of two years tells you that you've been working for a front company for the CIA, and that it's being shut down, and that you can't leave because everyone in the room is about to be killed... That's Jamie's morning, and it only looks to get worse as he discovers that everyone <em>else</em> in his office is a spy, a thug, a double-agent, or something worse.



<em>Severance Package</em> was written by an ex-Marvell comic book writer, and it shows; scenes practically <em>beg</em> to jump into panels and splash themselves across a glossy spread as Family Man Jamie, HR Lady Nicole, Assistant Molly, and the rest of the company team go Lord of the Flies to cover their asses, protect their agendas, and try to get out alive. It's heavy on the action, with a lot of jumping from one character's perspective to another's, but there are interesting breathers that help flesh out the "How did this <em>happen?</em> parts of the story.



The book is a fun hit-and-run, though the denouement feels a little rough, and I'll probably be tracking down the rest of the author's stuff to see what he comes up with.
