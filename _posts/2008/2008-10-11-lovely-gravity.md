I tend to steer clear of space opera these days, since my tastes tend towards near-future wackiness and various cyberpunk descendants. Scott Westerfield has one worth checking out, though: well-paced space battles that make me think of Horatio Hornblower instead of Star Wars fanfic, and enough curious background politics to give a broader context to the action.

A definite two-thumbs up; the only drawback is the first book's abrupt ending. Its sequel, <em>The Killing of Worlds</em> isn't a sequel at all; the two books form a single cliffhanger and splitting them was an act of profound malice by the publisher. I forgive them, though.
