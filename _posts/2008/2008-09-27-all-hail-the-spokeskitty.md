Anyone who sees my Flickr feed knows that I... occasionally take pictures of my cats. You know. Occasionally. Well, as it turns out, Maddie -- the tortoise-shell tabby -- is so damn cute that Paws & Purrs, the pet rescue we got her from, is going to be using her on some of their promotional literature.

Is it silly to think this is awesome? She's cute. CUTE, people! And now I can say that she's an actual, honest-to-goodness spokeskitty. Hell yeah.

In all seriousness, <a href="http://www.pawsandpurrs.org/">Paws & Purrs</a> is a really awesome group of dedicated caring people. Maddie and Joe and their sister were rescued in winter after someone left them in a freezing box outside a store. They nursed them back to health, and we were lucky enough to give 'em a home. Kitties rock.

If you've got a local shelter and you love kitties, check 'em out. Donations and time are always a huge help, and <em>cute furry things</em> are counting on you.
