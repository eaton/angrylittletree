The next few months are looking pretty busy in terms of travel and teaching and presenting. A quick rundown of the schedule, with some tentative dates:

<ul><li><strong><a href="http://drupalcampchicago.org/">October 25th: DrupalCamp Chicago</a></strong><br />

While DrupalCamp schedules stay fuzzy until the morning of the event, it looks like I'll be doing two sessions. Views 2 gets some love (naturally), and I'll also be doing <em>Soup to Structure</em>, a session on turning Drupal's normally fluid content model into a coherent site structure.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.doitwithdrupal.com">December 10th-12th: Do It With Drupal</a></strong><br />

James Walker and I will be presenting <em>"How We Built Twitter in Drupal,"</em> a session on grafting social messaging features onto Drupal, and how to leverage them effectively. It should be fun, especially since I've used "Don't build Twitter in Drupal" as a catchphrase for quite a while...</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org">March 4th-7th: DrupalCon '09</a></strong><br />

The final session lineup is still being ironed out, but I've pitched two sessions for the next DrupalCon. <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/building-apis-rock">Building APIs That Rock</a> is looking like the front-runner so far, and I think it'll be an interesting session. Plus, puppets.</li>

<li><strong><a href="http://www.sxsw.com">March 13th-17th: SXSW Interactive '09</a></strong><br />

Final sessions haven't been announced for SXS yet, but depending on how things go I'll either be participating in one of the CMS-related panel discussions, or moderating <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1726">Drupal With Its Pants Off</a>. The idea is to hold a No-BSâ„¢ panel discussion about building mission-critical Drupal sites, helping evaluators spot the pitfalls and take advantage of the easy wins.</li></ul>
