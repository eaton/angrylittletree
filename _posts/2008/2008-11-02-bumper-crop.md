Another day, another photo, another blog post. It's just under the wire, but I'm determined to keep things rolling. I've been spending some time this weekend going over the book and reading for last-minute technical errors -- I can only imagine what John VanDyk had to juggle doing <em>Pro Drupal Development</em> solo. I salute you, sir.



Catherine and I got a bit of a -- well, no, quite a bit of a scare today when Smoky Joe decided to take a walk on the banister... and lost his footing. Catherine heard the clatter, and made it to the stairs in time to see Joe recovering from a full fall down the stairwell. Being full of catlike grace, he landed <em>on his face</em>. Bleeding a bit and stunned, he hobbled up the stairs and paused while we freaked out... but careful observation and a call with the vet indicates that he's okay. No signs of a concussion, no broken bones as best as we can tell, and he's eating fine.



He's got the kitty equivalent of a split lip and a fat cheek, but the swelling is going down and he's starting to romp again. He looks like quite the street scuffler: any younger, more impressionable kittens will be sure to act impressed and give him wide berth.
