So I fired up Viva Piñata for the DS last night. I'll post a full review later when I've had a chance to get deeper into the game, but for the time being I'm a little unsettled.



In the tutorial, a living pinata named Hudson taught me how to hit houses with a shovel. Then, he led me through the process of dosing other piñatas with aphrodisiacs and introducing them to each other.



"Romancing is the easiest way to get new piñatas for your garden!"



A decade ago, I don't think any of us anticipated the market for handheld piñata-pimping simulations. Certainly not ones with such excellent graphics.
