Soaked in blood and in a totally shattered state, even his co-worker collapsed unconscious. But Balram did not lose heart. He kick-started the van and went to a nearby doctor who advised him to immediately rush to Agra. The first nursing home on the way refused him admission as he was in a critical state."</i></a>

OK, that's it. The guy who cut off his arm and hiked to safety, now this guy... I'm starting to feel very sub-hardcore. In other news, US Passport Services is kicking around the idea of <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/31885.html" target="_blank">biometric smart-card passports.</a> A group of Cubans MacGyver'd a truck into a pontoon boat and <a href="http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/news/nation/6368965.htm" target="_blank"><i>attempted to drive to Florida.</i></a> the Center for Science in the Public Interest asks the tough questions, and comes to the shocking conclusion that <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20030724/od_nm/health_icecream_dc_5&cid=573" target="_blank">Ice Cream isn't Health Food.</a>

And finally, from my superhero Bruce Sterling, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/view.html?pg=4" target="_blank">An interesting editorial for Wired on Europe's future as a potential second superpower.</a>
<blockquote><i>The aptly named Convention on the Future of Europe, a 105-member committee chaired by the former French president Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, is poised to create - really - a president and a politburo of some kind, a vice president, a foreign secretary, and a constitution. This will be no picnic, especially with the French at the wheel. They'll have to hammer out a bill of rights amid power struggles over vetoes and representation. If it were anybody but Europeans, they'd die before it was over from the sheer boredom of all that negotiating.</i></blockquote>
