Mmmmm. So after last night's mad rush to get relationship cardinality working in the object framework at the office, I bopped over to the gym. Mmm, paaaaaain. Ran about two miles, lifted for about half an hour... I'm feeling more comfortable there, less self conscious about the fact that I'm not one of the triangle-shaped guys in a Gold's Gym t-shirt who bench press 250 to warm up. Me? I'm doing curls at 25 lbs now, trying to build up endurance before increasing the weight. It's quelle whussy, but I can tell it's having an impact. My dedicated personal trainer <a href="http://mitomi.livejournal.com">mitomi</a> is giving loads of pointers and links to GIFs of how-to-do-this-the-right-way illustrations.

Realizing that I can run three miles without dying also helps. It's nice to discover that your body just has a different set of strengths than the body-builder types. Huzzah.
