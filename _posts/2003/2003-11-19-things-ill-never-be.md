Had a long an fruitful conversation last night with <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a>... among other things, we talked about the idea of comparisons. Specifically, the people we compare ourselves to without thinking.

It's so easy for each of us to hold up other people as ideals -- examples of what we <i>wish we could be.</i> Sometimes those archetypical targets of envy or longing are people we know and interact with daily. You know... the coworker who exudes confidence and competence while we stumble and struggle. The mentor who always seems so far ahead. The friend who always has the right thing to say and seems so <i>together.</i> Sometimes they're people from our past -- the guy who couldn't fail in high school, and everyone admired... or the girl whose family was perfect, and always had the Miss Teen looks. Other times the points of comparison are abstract -- the <i>perfect person</i> that we fear everyone wants us to be. The <i>insightful, knowledgable leader</i> who would know what to do when we're baffled and helpless. The Halmark-Ad confidante who would know just what to say to a mourning friend while we stand at the sidelines, dumbstruck with mute sympathy.

It seems that the reflexive response is always to dismiss these comparisons. To deny that the points of difference are important. To pretend that the jock <i>isn't</i> more gifted than I am at sports. To pretend that the charismatic guy who gets all the girls <i>isn't</i> really what women want. Or at the very least, to pretend that those things don't matter.

Whether I like it or not, though, those things <i>do</i> matter.

I am who I am, and my abilities and gifts and skills are part of who I am. Sometimes, I wish that I had been born with or cultivated a different set. One that would leave me confident, self-assured, suave and cool and collected. Perhaps more attractive to women. Perhaps less sensitive to others around me, that I could push forward and sieze what I want without feeling biting twinges of empathy and remorse.

But I am who I am, and I live with that.

Instead of denying those differences, instead of pretending that they do not exist or do not matter, I have to look at them long and hard and realize that where I fall short, where others are better or stronger or more worthy or more attractive or wiser or more clever than I am... I am still me.

Even though I do not measure up to those people in very obvious and important ways, I am who I am. I am who I am for a reason, for a purpose, and I have chosen to become this person. Every choice also implies that something has been abandoned -- other options that could have been pursued, outcomes that are no longer likely, etc. I have to learn, every day, to embrace the person that I am. With weaknesses, failings, strengths... and to go on.
