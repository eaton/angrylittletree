<a href="http://shig23.livejournal.com">shig23</a>, I picked up <a href="http://www.transmetropolitan.com" target="_blank"><i>Transmetropolitan</i></a>vol. 1. Excellent stuff. I haven't really liked much of Warren Ellis' writing on his blog, but the comic is definitely, absolutely, without question very slick. I want to be Spider Jerusalem when I grow up, but with a lot less amphetamines.

Along the way, I also snagged a mid-season comp of <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Comics/Titles/I/Invisibles/?il=1" target="_blank"><i>The Invisibles</i></a> (I discovered the guy who's been doing the current New X-Men story arc has an entire pantheon of comic continuity behind him) and the first collection of <a href="http://www.comicreaders.com/mainstreamreviews_ythelastman2.shtml" target="_blank"><i>Y: The Last Man On Earth</i></a> (written by the guy who brought us Sentinel, a story of puppy-love and robotic killing machines). Good stuff, fun stuff all of them. I don't necessarily like the content of <i>The Invisibles</i> as much as I could, but it reads like a comic book version of <i>Foucault's Pendulum,</i> and that's enough for me.

The <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/teaser.html" target="_blank">Havana Mod</a> work that Jason and I had been doing a month ago is picking up again. We're putting together the props for one of the key scenes in the next shoot, and I'm making a bunch of exotic custom currencies to print up on my inkjet printer when we need close-ups of money changing hands. Nothing says "wacky dystopian future" like $50 bills with the Sony logo.
