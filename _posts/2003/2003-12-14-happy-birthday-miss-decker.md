So last night, the big event was a surprise party for <a href="http://rdecker.livejournal.com">rdecker</a> -- all told, something like thirty people showed up. Family, old friends from out of state, the crew from Fusion, and more. It was very cool, and she was shocked. There was much good pasta, lots of laughing, and she <i>didn't suspect a thing.</i> Hooray!

<a href="http://jefner1.livejournal.com">jefner1</a> had the camera for most of the evening, and snapped some nifty shots of Decker and the rest of the gang.
