So, yes. That last post was a little bit of a downer. Friends don't let friends post to LiveJournal after 2:00am, and all that.

I suppose the point that got lost in all of the self-centered wallowing was that I'm realizing (once again) how affected I am by my past experiences with relationships. Those things shape how I see and interperet and respond to the things around me now. When I see situations in which "love" would cause me to take chances, or to sacrifice in some way, my immediate reaction is to think, "Wow, <i>that's</i> sure worked out well in the past..." Naturally, the voice in my head saying it posesses a level of sarcasm that can kill small birds at 30 feet.

To some extent, I feel as if I spent all my hope and went bust. It's not just a question of bucking up and trying again -- despite what I "know" is the "healthy" approach to relationships, I genuinely <i>believe</i> that things will turn out badly in the end, at least when it comes to matters of the heart. I'm not quite sure how to change that fundamental belief... It would feel a bit like trying to overcome my inherent aversion to walking off of cliffs. I can tell myself that it depends on the cliff, and that some would turn out fine, but my fundamental view of the world around me says, "What would you possibly gain by trying <i>that</i>?"

I'm capable of changing my own beliefs. I have no one to blame for the things I do and believe -- they are my choices and mine alone. But do I <i>want</i> to change them? Do I believe that changing them would be a positive step, or just a jump into the rose-colored world of delusional pollyanna thinking? I don't know.

Eh. Time to hack my psyche again.
