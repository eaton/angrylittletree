I just finished a two hour long meeting that left me energized. There's a spring in my step and a smile on my face -- the three of us spent the time brainstorming solutions to some framework problems we're having with the app. Phrases like "cache status management" and "concurrency issues" were thrown about with reckless abandon. We got a chance to wrap our brains around conceptual challenges, think through the ramifications of our solutions, propose alternatives, and so on.

It's moments like this that remind my why I love software development so much. To say that our jobs are about "writing computer code" is equivalent to saying that an architect's job is to draw lines on grid paper. The challenge and the pleasure of it comes from seeing a problem, seeing a need, and tackling it to find out a solution that's both functional and aesthetically pleasing -- the two fundamental aspects of beauty. The mechanical aspects (writing code, drawing lines, etc) are the fruition of that creative process.
