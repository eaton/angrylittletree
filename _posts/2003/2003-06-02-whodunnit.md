So I'm running a virus check on my laptop at work today and I stumble across the former owner's WinMX directory. There's a bunch of MP3age in it, but as I skim over the titles, a cold chill creeps down my spine.

<i>FX: Thunder crash, orchestra hit</i>

Someone... someone here in this office... voluntarily downloaded Patsy Kline Karaoke files.

<a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> vehemently denies having used the laptop. We haven't asked Dave yet. But suspicion abounds, and the atmosphere of trust and comaderie that filled the office last week has an undercurrent of fear...

Who <i>can</i> we trust?
