So I sleep through my alarm this morning and wake up late. I suddenly reconsider the trip I was planning on taking with a couple of friends to Michigan today; I've got 15 minutes until I was supposed to meet them in downtown Chicago.

Should I go? Shouldn't I? I look outside: the storm last night knocked a good chunk of the <i>tree</i> next to my driveway down, blocking my car in until I can clear it.

If that doesn't qualify as <i>an omen</i>, I'm not sure what does.
