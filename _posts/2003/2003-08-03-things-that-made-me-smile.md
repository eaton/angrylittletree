Natalie: but your pictures are sooooo pretty.  you need to show the world your love!
Natalie: I don't like the last picture though
Jeff Eaton: really?
Jeff Eaton: the squirrel looked kind of pissed off at me.
Natalie: oh, as a picture it's lovely, I guess.  I can't get past my fear of squirrels.  sorry
Jeff Eaton: ooooh
Jeff Eaton: that's right, i forgot about that. I'm sorry!
Jeff Eaton: I think he was scared of me and a little indignant.
Natalie: I looked at a squirrel for a few moments the other day, it wasn't so bad.
Jeff Eaton: he kept chittering and hopping farther up the tree, then turning around and glaring at me and chittering more.
Natalie: it was probably thinking of ways to kill you 
Natalie: damn squirrels
Jeff Eaton: i think he was more concerned with the nut.
Natalie: don't be fooled, young jeff.....
Jeff Eaton: they're evil?
Natalie: they like you to think they're just concerned with their nuts.  they are plotting to kill and take over
Jeff Eaton: &lt;kent_brockman&gt;I, for one, would like to be the first to welcome our new squirrel overloards.&lt;/kent_brockman&gt;
