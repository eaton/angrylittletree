It's unsettling how responsive my emotional states are to my perception of my appearance. Lately, though, I've been having a series of what I call <i>Good Me Days.</i> It's like a full-body good hair day. Part of it's purely superficial. A different haircut that I'm happier with, and is easier to maintain. It's kinda swanky but I can get myself arranged in the morning with fingers-through-the-hair instead of combing and drying. I approve of that. I've been wearing mostly business casual lately, too. Nice simple clean outfits in dark earth tones and black. The kind of stuff that punches the happy buttons in those centers of my brain wired to enjoy IKEA and VW bugs and elegant typography. And the additional exercise at the gym, although it hasn't really had any visible effect, has me feeling better, feeling more proactive.

So this weekend I had my straight cut broken in jeans, my black T-shirt, and my copy of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0061300047/qid=1054485608/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-8868983-0060851?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" target="_blank">Purity of Heart Is to Will One Thing</a></i>. I felt good. I felt like me, the way I look in my head when I close my eyes. It was a Good Me Day.

<i>Not being tense but ready. Not thinking but not dreaming. Not being set but flexible. Liberation from the uneasy sense of confinement. It is being wholly and quietly alive, aware and alert, ready for whatever may come. --Bruce Lee</i>
