For those who aren't rabidly opposed to the meme du jour, <lj-cut text="interviews follow.">

From <a href="http://carleelauren.livejournal.com">carleelauren</a><b>:</b>

<b>How would you describe yourself to someone you didn't know (like me)?</b>
Mmmm. Tough one. Skewed... passionate... goofy...

<b>What/who are your greatest influences today?</b>
In theory, being a Christian, I should probably say something like "Jesus," but I won't. It's cheesy, blindingly obvious, and I don't have any plans to be crucified for the sins of mankind anytime soon. If I were to choose recently living or currently alive public figures, I'd say Richard Feynman, Graham Cooke, and Bruce Sterling are three that stand out immediately. Feynman for his insatiable thirst for knowledge, his joy in discovery, and his ability to pass that on to others. I love that, and I want to embody it as well. Graham Cooke, mostly because of his controversially spiffy views on the modern Church, and how it must change in the coming years. Sterling for many of the same reasons I chose Feynman. In addition, I love his ability to pull those varied interests and passions together into a coherent narrative, a vision of what the future might be like if today's trends continue.

There are quite a few others, too -- Persig, the author of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance... Shane Clayborn, the guy who helps renovate abandoned buildings in Philly's inner city... I'd run out of space if I tried to list everyone. People who demonstrate passion, insight, and compassion tend to stand out in my mind. Even if I don't know them personally, those who demonstrate those characteristics usually end up becoming a heavy influence on my life and how I see the world around me.

<b>What is one thing you'd like to do/see/hear before you die?</b>
Transcontinental road trip. Boats used for the ocean-crossing. Mmmmmmmmm. See the world, take photos, meet people, soak in the sights and smells of new places... What's not to love?

<b>What is the meaning of life, to you?</b>
To do, and become, more good every day. To communicate both truth and love in equal measures to those around me. To know and be known. To finally beat the last level of Deus Ex without using any cheats.

<b>What is one thing you could not live without?</b>
Connection to others.

<a href="http://breezygirl.livejournal.com">breezygirl</a> asks:

<b>what is your favorite element?</b>
Americium. It's the most patriotic of all deadly radioactive substances!

<b>cheesy gordita crunch or chalupa?</b>
Cheesy gordita. No questino. Although the chalupas are fine fine eating, the gordita will always have my heart.

<b>if there is new order, who is old order?</b>
Kraftwerk, naturally!

<b>favorite offbeat name for a pet?</b>
Kevin.

<b>favorite PC term for getting laid off?</b>
"We've been right-sized." (Downsizing just sounds too negative, doesn't it?)

Over the next couple of days, I'll update this entry if new questions come in. Less spam, more fun! I do it because I care.
