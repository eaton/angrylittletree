<a href="http://broohaha.livejournal.com">broohaha</a> <b> asks, Do you wear black a lot?</b>
Not black, per se, but lots of greys and muted earth tones. I'm red/green colorblind, so playing it safe with colors is a survival trait. Even now, I sometimes mistake pink T-shirts for grey ones. That's no good at all, nope.

<a href="http://broohaha.livejournal.com">broohaha</a> <b> asks,  What is really amazingly great about yourself? [No sarcastic answers, or at least, answer for real after the sark. More than 1 answer = extra credit.]</b>
Errrrr... Yeah, now I'm at a loss. All my sarcasm generators are spasming reflexively now. It's genuinely frightening to think and talk about the things I <i>like</i> about myself... surely, that can't be healthy. I guess i'd have to say the things I like about myself are empathy and care for others... and my passion and hunger for understanding. Not necessarily 'information' or 'knowledge' ... just understanding. But... yeah. Um. Insert sarcastic, snappy comment here?

<a href="http://staralfur8000.livejournal.com">staralfur8000</a> <b> asks,  What is the fastest and easiest way to become incredibly hip and cool and make everyone like you?</b>
<ol>
<li>Design a foolproof nuclear battery, a new way to factor large prime numbers, or some other cool thing.</li>
<li>Post to Slashdot.</li>
<li>PROFIT!</li>
<li>Everyone likes you.</li>
</ol>
Unfortunately, that fast and easy way is riddled with peril, and it's also likely to crush your server under hits from slashdot for at least a day or two. The long-term approach involves becoming the kind of person <i>you</i> would want to confide in and trust.

The gnomes, dear. It's the gnomes.


<a href="http://substitute.livejournal.com">substitute</a> <b> asks,  WHY NOT SNEEZE RROSE SELAVY?!?!?!?!?</b>
Clearly, you've mixed up your letters. Did you mean to ask, "<a href="http://www.wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=WHY+NOT+SNEEZE+RROSE+SELAVY" target="_blank">O zen healer, Roy says vows?</a>"

<a href="http://razornails.livejournal.com">razornails</a> <b> asks,  Why haven't you added me to your friends list? :)</b>
Wha... er... Hey! You've got me on your friends list!  *blink!*
