I've mentioned <a href="http://www.plastic.com" target="_blank">Plastic</a> a few times -- it's a meta-discussion site, like <a href="http://www.slashdot.org" target="_blank">Slashdot</a> or <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org" target="_blank">K5</a>, that focuses on pop culture/current event news. I've been there for quite a while, since it grew out of the collapse of the late great <a href="http://www.suck.com" target="_blank">Suck.com</a>.

I'm rated "astute, informative, funny, brilliant" with a low but respectable 72 points of Karma, and its parser says that my favorite words to use on the site are "though, women, israel, point, money, perhaps, seems, agree, everyone, and microsoft."

Random trivia.
