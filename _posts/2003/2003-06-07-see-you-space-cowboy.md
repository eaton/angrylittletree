There's nothing quite so beautiful as a long walk in the rain at two in the morning, with jazz music.

Got home from the party late; the drizzle made everything catch the light and Chet Baker was playing. So I parked, stretched, and tucked my discman into my waistband. And walked.

Streetlights reflected on the wet sidewalk and my tall, lanky shadow stretched out in front of me. It was crisscrossed by the shadows of the telephone lines that ran parallel to the road. Hands in my pockets, shirt plastered wet to my back, fat drops splashing on me as the shower intensified. The wail of Chet's slow trumpet almost covered the light hiss of the rain.

Life is beautiful.
