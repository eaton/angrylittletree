Good for you! Considering the endless complexity of the universe, as well as whatever discipline you happen to be most interested in, you'll never be bored as long as you have a good book store, a net connection, and thousands of dollars worth of expensive equipment. Assuming you're a technical geek, you'll be able to afford it, too. If you're not a technical geek, you're geek enough to mate with a technical geek and thereby get the needed dough. <B>Dating tip</b>: Don't date a geek of the same persuasion as you. You'll constantly try to out-geek the other.</td></tr></table> <p><a href="http://www.thudfactor.com/geekquiz.php">Take the Polygeek Quiz at Thudfactor.com</a></p>
