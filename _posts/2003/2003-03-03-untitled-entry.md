ANGER
1. Who did you last get angry with? <b>A friend who hurt me.</b>

3. Would you hit a member of the opposite sex? <b>Only if threatened.</b>
4. How about of the same sex? <b>Same deal -- only if threatened. I figure, if someone's going to knife me or something like that, gender equality kicks in and I get an attack of opportunity. If I'm not in danger though, I wouldn't hit a man or a woman.</b>
5. Who was the last person who got really angry at you? <b>A jealous friend.</b>
6. Do you keep grudges, or can you let them go easily? <b>I let grudges go pretty easily -- it's harder when the cause of the original offense is an ongoing behavior that I have to deal with regularly...</b>

SLOTH

2. What is the latest you've ever woken up? <b>7:00 PM. Post-road-trip coma.</b>
3. Name a person you've been meaning to contact, but haven't yet? <b>Jeff Brown.</b>

5. Have you ever watched an infomercial all the way through (one of the long ones...)? <b>Who <i>isn't</i> fascinated by spray-on hair?</b>
6. When was the last time you got a good workout in? <b>Not including ultimate frisbee? Sometime last year. Egh.</b>
7. How many times did you hit the snooze button on your alarm clock today? <b>Once.</b>

GLUTTONY
1. What is your overpriced yuppie beverage of choice? <b>Arizona Iced Tea? I'm not sure if that's a yuppie beverage, really...</b>
2. Meat eaters: white meat or dark meat? <b>Dark. Yum.</b>
3. What is the greatest amount of alcohol you've had in one sitting/outing/event? <b>Half a glass of wine.</b>

4. Have you "done it"? <b>"It" is a pretty ambugious word, don't you think?</b>
5. What is your favorite body part on a person of your gender of choice? <b>The nape of the neck.</b>

3. If you had $1 million, what would you do with it? <b>Grab a nice 2-bedroom apartment and start a small grant fund for promising new media artists.</b>
4. Would you rather be rich, or famous? <b>Rich. Both fame and riches are fleeting, but it's easier to buy fame than hustle money. Just look at how many celebrities file for bankruptcy...</b>
5. Would you accept a boring job if it meant you would make megabucks? <b>No.</b>
6. Have you ever stolen anything? <b>Yep. I was young and stupid and was crushed with guilt afterwards, returning it to the owner.</b>

4. Have you ever been cheated on? <b>Not as such.</b>
5. Have you ever wished you had a physical feature different from your own? <b>Every morning.</b>
