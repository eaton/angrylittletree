So I was picking and poking through some of the earliest entries I made in my LiveJournal. <b><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/predicate/3242.html">this one</a></b> made me laugh -- it's about one of the first times I ever spoke at length to <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a>. I can say without hesitation that he's now one of my closest friends. Almost two years later, I can look back and say that my life would be very, very different had it not happened.

And I smile.
