<b><a href="http://breezygirl.livejournal.com">breezygirl</a> -- do you and jason share the same brain? or just swap pieces of brain matter?</b>
Contrary to popular opinion, Jason and I do not share a brain. At set intervals, we swap portions of grey matter and reintegrate in order to keep the hive-mind syncronized.

From the description of your symptoms, you may be suffering from acute infopollen exposure. Please seek professional medical assistance as soon as possible. Thank you!

<b><a href="http://mitomi.livejournal.com">mitomi</a> -- What do you want to be known for?</b>
I want to be known for goodness. I guess that requires some explaination -- I don't want to be seen as a <i>good person</i> in the sense that we normally think of it. I know that I'm a fallen, broken, failing human being. I am acutely aware of my own weaknesses as much as my strengths. But I truly desire to be good. To live a life marked by kindness, and beauty, and care, and truth, sincerity and transparency and love. I want it to affect other people and to ripple out and touch others I'll never even meet or know.

As I think about it, that'd be one hell of a legacy.

<b><a href="http://humblepen7.livejournal.com">humblepen7</a> -- If you were a woman and could go on a date with any male celebrity excluding Jude Law, who would it be?</b>
I... I... but... who is there save Jude Law? Barring his incomparible self, probably... ummm... James Caviezel.

<b><a href="http://shulamite.livejournal.com">shulamite</a> -- what veggies do you like in your chicken soup</b>
Celery, tomato chunks, and a touch of garlic. Carrots are way out.
