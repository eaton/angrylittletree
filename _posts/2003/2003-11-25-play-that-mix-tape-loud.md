Via <a href="http://www.defensetech.org/archives/000676.html" target="_blank">DefenseTech</a>... Random bits and pieces about increasing government intrusions into private space for 'security' reasons. Did you know that your swanky new BMW has built-in microphones and a cellular link? Did you know that the FBI can get permission to turn it on, monitoring everything you say in your car? Interesting stuff.

And, fresh from <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,61357,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2" target="_blank">Wired News</a>, a company called VeriChip is finally getting around to marketing the mark of the beast. It's been vaporware for a long time, and i'm glad to see the thing's finally shipping.
