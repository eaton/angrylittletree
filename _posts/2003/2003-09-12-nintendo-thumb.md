So <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> and I played Soul Calibur II until, what, 2am last night? I have painful, swollen Nintendo Thumb, just like the old days. At least it's not Street Fighter -- I'd be bloody and raw if I were trying to do fireballs... Heh.

Damn you and your Raphael, Jason. Taki will get you, yet...
