One might be excused for saying that I am currently <i>displeased</i> with Sony.

While I've long enjoyed their consumer electronics products, and the Playstation 2 is certainly a fine piece of engineering, their computer products have of late left me with a slightly <i>unpleasant</i> taste.

Witness the Sony Vaio PCGRX560 laptop. A fine laptop, with a pretty 1600x1200 LCD screen that's a pleasure to use. Until, of course, the machine's motherboard fails and it refuses to boot, or spontaneously powers down, weeks out of warranty.

Also witness the recovery disks for the Sony Vaio RX370 desktop computer. Should a problem befall your computer, you'd best have God on your side. Not only is the computer incapable of booting from its DVD drive, rendering your emergency restore-and-install-Windows DVD useless, the recovery CDs that ship with the computer are not in fact <i>recovery</i> CDs as one might expect.

These sneaky little bastards wait until you boot from them, and promptly repartition the first drive they see. What? You didn't want your 120 gig data drive full of music, art, registration keys for all the software you've purchased electronically, and original art for Havana Moderne reformatted as a 16 gig FAT32 partition with Windows ME? Oh. So sorry!

MY prodigous 60 gig music collection is gone, the high-res originals for <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/teaser.html" target="_blank">Havana Moderne</a> are gone, the installers and reg keys for all my Sonic Foundry products are gone, pretty much everything that doesn't come on a CD with the Microsoft or Adobe logo is gone.

But hey...

I had a really good cinnamon roll.
