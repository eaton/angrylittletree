So the weekend was up and down. Friday, arrived home and slumped and collapsed and got into a 6 hour or so discussion with the family about sexual identity, gay/lesbian/bi issues, and the like. It was good. (For the curious in the audience, I'm straight. This is just the kind of stuff that we strike up conversations about over Scrabble.)

Saturday consisted of errand-running to get state forms for duplicate auto title applications, mailing ticket mayments and accident reports, and all the other fun stuff that follows your car being totalled. <a href="http://humblepen7.livejournal.com">humblepen7</a> let me bum a ride to the midnight bowling gig with the rest of the <a href="http://www.fusioncentral.net" target="_blank">Fusion</a> crew. <a href="http://gundi.livejournal.com">gundi</a>and <a href="http://jefner1.livejournal.com">jefner1</a> showed up, along with various other folks that are not yet members of the scary world of livejournal. An old friend of <a href="http://gundi.livejournal.com">gundi</a>'s was also along for the ride and we lent moral support. Yay.

The excursion to Denny's that followed was yummy, pun-filled, and sleep deprived.

Sunday, <a href="http://www.cekta.com/M242" target="_blank">Problem19</a> showed up and the afternoon quickly spiraled into <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com" target="_blank">MechWarrior: Dark Age</a> cherrypicking. Although, technically, if you get ALL the available boosters, it's not cherrypicking, is it? No. Didn't think so. P19 made out like a bandit, though. He pulled some solid heavy armor units, as well as a unique Atlas heavy mech and the Kendra Jade unique. If we ever get around to playing some 400-500 point pickup games, I have the feeling his Atlas will bring me a world of pain. 6 clicks of ballistic damage. Streak missiles. 23 defense with hardened armor. It has alpha strike capabilities. Lord have mercy. It's a walking fortress with a mean hangover.

Subsequent 60-minute pickup battles were a blast, although he schooled me. I knew my All Singing, All Dancing All Hovercraft Army was chancy, but I let him funnel me too quickly. Hindering terrain and well-placed blocking buildings combined with my impatience and turned the middle of the battlefield into a shooting gallery. Only a series of lucky rolls and a well-timed ramming attempt kept me from being annihilated. When time ran out, he was still in a good position to shred me with his Behemoth heavy tank. Hovercrafts: they're nifty, but they cumple like tinfoil.

I think I'm learning to make better use of my hoverbikes, though. You just have to keep them pristine until they've done their jobs. The armor piercing weapons they haul around are handy, but disappear after the first click. Push them even once, and they're useless against armor. Doh!
