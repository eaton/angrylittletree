yeah, so <a href="http://jefner1.livejournal.com">jefner1</a> is talking about a fusion poetry slam this summer. i think it's a smashing idea. she seems, though, to be under the mistaken impression that i should read some of my stuff.

i laugh.

the majority of the stuff i write is intensely personal, and coincidentally also sucks. it's been a big step posting it in textual form -- reading it in front of other people? geh.
