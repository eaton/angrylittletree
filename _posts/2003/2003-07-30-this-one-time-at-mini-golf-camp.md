So I went mini-golfing with the Fusion crew last night, and both <a href="http://texasjeff.livejournal.com">texasjeff</a> and <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> showed up as well. Fun, fun! At one point, the infamous notebook of doom was passed around with a Top Ten List. Last night's title? "Best Name For a Kitten/Transdimensional Warlord." Bubbles was a popular choice, and various other goofy names were selected as the notebook made the rounds. Later, though, we discovered that <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> and I had both, without each others' knowledge, independently selected the name 'Horatio.' Just pulled it out of a hat, without consulting each other or peeking at the list of names.

Bwah. Hah hah.
