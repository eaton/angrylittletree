okay, so here i am writing a letter that i know i'll never send. stupid? probably. that and a hundred other things. but i have to write this, or i'll go insane and regret it for the rest of my life. regret not getting these things out there somewhere, instead of keeping them capped up inside.

remember that time all of us were at the parking garage in aurora, and danny said we'd regret it for the rest of our lives if we didn't climb down the wall outside instead of taking the stairs? that's what i feel like now -- i don't know if my grip's strong enough to keep me from falling, from sending this to you, but if i don't at least write it i'll spend the rest of my life looking at edges and thinking what i almost did.

i remember the first time we met at that coffeehouse on adams street, and i remember thinking that you were some hopelessly screwed up artsy type. one of the people i could admire from a far, watch and enjoy until she flamed out. you were wearing jeans, i think -- a black tanktop and bluejeans, with worn boots and your hair piled into a messy topknot. you were sitting indian style on your chair and talking to danny about magic. how sad it was that the world didn't have any real magic like in stories and movies.

i noticed your tattoo and i noticed your lips. it's embarassing to admit something like that -- a tiny little thing, i guess. but the full curves of your lips, the perfect tug of a smile that touched your eyes before anything else... i watched and sipped a latte as you talked to danny and i thought to myself that you looked passionate. not in some stupid sexualized cliche way, just... passionate. in your soul.

definitely a burnout waiting to happen, i thought to myself. (ha ha...)

we ended up talking later when i said hi to him, and he went to get another drink. you probably don't remember it, but i do. i told you the tattoo was cool, and asked you what it meant. you twisted your shoulder around to show me, and i traced the foreign shapes with my fingertip. "love," you answered. "it's in chinese."

"What's that?"

"Chinese?"

"No, love."

You squinted at me like i was an idiot before realizing what i meant. and in that second the look on your face transformed, from just-another-woman-child to someone-who's-seen-the-stars-and-wants-to-touch-them. "Love is something everyone needs," you answered slowly, losing your smile. "Something everyone wants... and a few people find."

I wondered about you. "Any luck?"

"I'll let you know if I do."

And you did.

i remember the moment i knew i loved you.

it was jer's birthday two years ago, after everyone went upstairs to watch mad max on the big screen. we both stayed in the basement because we were too lazy, and after a few minutes of silence you yawned and said that you wished you'd been born rich. i laughed and rolled over on the couch to look at you. and i saw you, sitting crosslegged on the floor, looking through old magazines you'd found in jer's closet and looking like you could cry. and then i stopped laughing.

"i want to do something," you whispered as you stared at a black and white of jfk pressing the flesh. you traced his flat grainy cheek with your nail and didn't look up. "I want to do something that everybody will see, but I know i can't. i'm just me, I'm just a stupid girl from the sticks," you said just loud enough for me to hear.

i held my breath.

"look at them. they had everything going for them and they didn't even do it. they had money and families and everything." you dug your nail into the magazine's brittling paper, tearing fibers and digging a groove into jackie o's chin. "it didn't do them any good."

i stared at you in the dim light as you pushed the magazine away and curled up to go to sleep, right there on the floor, and upstairs the gang was laughing at something. i could hear the sound of it through the floorboards.

"sorry," you murmured with your eyes closed, lips barely moving. I waited for a minute, thought of saying something just before you finished. "i didn't mean to sa all that." and you breathed deep and fell asleep.

"it's okay," i mouthed. you never heard me.

i knew you never would.
