Woke up at 9:00 this morning, freakishly early for me, to find the sun fighting through the blinds. Very cheery.

Unless there's some looming pantsload of work that needs to be done, they're ripe iwth possibilities and low on responsibility. Ironically, this usually makes me want to get up early and <i>accomplish</i> something. So I broke out the green, red, and yellow peppers and diced them up, got the celery cut up, diced the onion, and generally prepared for the stirfry I'm making this evening. It'll be the first time I've done it in the new place, and it has an innaugural sort of feel.

I really enjoy making stirfry -- it's one of the dishes that I'm not just passable at, but <i>good.</i> It doesn't take much expertise, but there's lots of room for experimentation and vadiation. Some garlic, some water chestnuts, timing the combination of the veggies and the stirfried meat <i>just so...</i> It's all good.
