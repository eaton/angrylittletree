So now I can post via email... it's pretty cool, neh?

I realize that I've been AWOL for a while, and there's no good reason for it. Nothing too exciting, nothing wilod and crazy save the usual march of work and meetings and work and sleep and work and pizza. Went to a LAN party with <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> on Halloween, which was quite swanky. UT2K3 and Halo 'til 2:30 AM is indeed a beautiful thing, and my custom comp CD worked nicely as background music for the carnage. Got in some Sweet Sweet Retro Lovin' with an old Syko Kommands song near the end. Although it sucks, in a most final and absolute fashion, it's full of memories for js0n and I. It's the song we used to have playing during out oldschool Marathon fragfests.

Everyone's mortal but me, baby.

Work's been... stressful but productive. Here's the deal -- the company I work for makes grocery store price management software. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Seriously, though, it's a huge industry. Even when the economy tanks, people still have to buy food, right? Right. so most of the backend systems these grocery retailers use were built in the 70's, maybe the early 80's, and they're just barely creaking along. Our CEO and visionary in residence is a guy with about 30+ years of experience in the industry. He helped build those old systems at a time when they were pretty slick and cutting edge. And now he' got a vision for the next generation.

It makes us a kind of David Startup vs. Goliath Consultancies. We're competing against companies lke Siebel, for crying out loud. But it's good fun work. Stressful though, since we're small enough that there's no one to pick up the slack if I screw up, or something like that. Our major client at the moment, Lowes Foods on the east coast, is sort of co-investing. They're helping subsidize the development of one of our flagship products, and we're customizing it for their needs. So it's symbiosis. Except that if it doesn't work out, they're incnvenienced and we're completely screwed. ;)

But, such is the life of a startup company, neh? It's all good. Maybe sometime I'll geek out tremendously and post some of the arcane details.

I've moved into an apartment with Benson -- <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a>. We've got it set up all nice and swanky, and I'll be posting photos soon (I swear, seriously). For some reason I just haven't been able to get the energy up to tromp out with the camera and start snapping photos for a while. Benson and I get along great, and any concerns there were about the apartment-sharing straining our friendship have proven unfounded. If anything, it's been a great chance to talk and get to know each other more. It's also been a rich source of jokes -- Benson and I now work, live, and often hang out together in the off hours. All Jeff! All the time!

Chances are he will be moving out in late Feb., when he gets married to his fiance. Which means I'll be hunting for a new roomate come 2004. Which is sad, since rooming with Jeff is and looks to be a really cool and enjoyable experience. There's a very small subset of people that I think I can share a place with and not be driven to madness...

Hmm. What else. What else?

Relationship related issues still kick my ass from time to time; embracing existentialism has helped considerably in the reducing-how-much-whining-I-do category. I understand that my choices and decisions have put me where I am, and ultimately I don't regret any of them. I've made decisions about how i want to live my life and the kinds of relationships I want to pursue, and I'm sticking with it. Coincidentally, this means I'll probably be single until Mary Kate and Ashely Olsen are entering menopause... But them's the breaks.

It's funny, thinking about it doesn't bother me much. I can shrug and say, 'Yeah? So?' I have good friends, great friends even, and I value those relationships a lot. Those relationships aren't a consolation prize, they're the trophy. Sometimes though, when I'm cruising through the grocery store and picking up ingredients for some nice wok-stirfy-goodness, or making a comp CD, or curled up with a good book, or walking around the complex in the crisp November air, or sitting sipping coffee in the sun on a lazy Saturday morning, I'm struck by the fact that I want it to be <i>with</i> someone. (Or perhaps <i>for</i> someone in the case of the comp CD.) There's nothing unique or novel about that really. Everyone experiences it. But it's those little subtle moments that hit hardest.

Of course, the aforementioned principles that I've decided to live my life by also mean that when I'm feeling lonely is the <i>worst</i> time to consider actually getting into a relationship... The catch-22 is amusing, if nothing else.

Mmmm. Yay. Rambling.

How'd this get so long?
