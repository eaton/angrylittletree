<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: I'm so mad at sean.
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: i just suggested that i could run 100 metres in 20 seconds. and he looked at me skeptically and said "you could run 50 metres in 20 seconds maybe..."
<a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a>: That's challenging, isn't it?
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: elite athletes (female) run 100 in 11 seconds. given that 11 seconds is a short amount of time, doubling it is not unreasonable, is it?
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: doubling that time would make me A LOT slower than the elite athletes. it just so happens that doubling it is only 20 seconds total. well, 22.
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: I could run 100 metres in 20 seconds.
<a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a>: I dunno. I don't think i could...
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: now sean says the end of our road is 100 metres. he's nuts....that's 200 metres.

[time passes]

<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: we've got maps out..... we have determined that the length of stoke fields is 100 metres.
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: he has his shoes on..... he says we're going for a run
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: I'll be back in 20 seconds.
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: plus,the amount of time it takes to walk to stoke fields.
<a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a>: Ummm....
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: brb!

[more time passes]

<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: back
<a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a>: And? ;)
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: and......
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: what?
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: oh *that*
<a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a>: How did the run go?
<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>: yes......i was slightly off in my calculation.

<a href="http://hawking.livejournal.com">hawking</a>: If I didn't have that Sony F505v, I wouldn't have gotten a Clie.
<a href="http://hawking.livejournal.com">hawking</a>: I would've gone for something else. :)
<a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a> grins. Same here, with the digital cam and the Clie.
<a href="http://hawking.livejournal.com">hawking</a>: Though Sony does make their gadgets attractive and nifty enough to make you overlook things like that. ;)
<a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a>: Sigh. They DO. They're good at making SLEEK things.
<a href="http://hawking.livejournal.com">hawking</a>: In a way, it's almost satisfying to know that Marketers are working with psychologists to make you happy. ;)
