<I>What would you say if you knew what I was thinking? 
Maybe you do but you know not to dig too deep 
What if I knew what you needed for sure? 
I've seen in your eyes you need more, much more 

And I could be happy, and you could be miserable 
I'll grab a metaphor out of the air 
The Cuyahoga river on fire 

What can you say, the impossible happens 
What can you settle for? 
What can you live without? 
I remember the night I first darkened your door 
And I swore that I loved you 
My heart was pure 

And you could be happy, and I could be miserable 
I'll grab a metaphor out of the air 
The Cuyahoga river on fire 

My open window, a dream in the dark 
My fingers, your face 
A spark, a trace 

I could be happy, and you could be miserable 
I'll grab a metaphor out of the air 
The Cuyahoga river on fire 

I know a lot about the history of Cleveland, Ohio 
Disasters that have happend there 
Like the Cuyahoga river on fire
