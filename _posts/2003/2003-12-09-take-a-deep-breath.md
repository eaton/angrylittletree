It's so easy to default to cynicism.

Relationships have baffled me for a long, long time -- at least, the ones that lie outside the comfortable, well-worn realm of the platonic. Forays outside of that realm have yielded predicable results. While only a few attempts might be considered <i>disastrous</i>, all can easily be classified as disappointing and unsuccessful. I recall my grandfather's sage advice when I asked him for advice about a girl who liked me: "She'll get over it," he said.

Heh.

But anyways, the point isn't to wallow in self-pity or anything annoying like that. It's to admit that I expect the worst, and am consistently rewarded. I understand self-defeating behaviors, I understand self-fulfilling prophecies. Unfortunately, no pep-talking and behavioral psych tricks have managed to change what I believe, in my heart of hearts: I'll spend my life alone. A lot of my emotional and psychological energy goes into 'being okay with that.' Making decisions for the right reasons, rather than scrambling to feel less lonely. When I try to contemplate any other possible futures (read, happy ones), it's inexplicably traumatic and foreign, like sticking my hand in <i>boiling marmelade</i>. Not only does it hurt, it's baffling.

This morning, though, I read a post by a relatively new LJ-friend, <a href="http://loachie.livejournal.com">loachie</a>. She's just discovered that she's pregnant for the first time. She and her husband are being sucked into an entire whirlwind of emotion and panic and joy and planning and anticipation.

I can't explain why, but her post was deeply comforting. I don't <i>believe</i> anything new, and it doesn't change my feelings about the possibilities of a healthy happy relationship in the future. Those are things I <i>understand.</i> But reading her description of their sudden life changes... I don't know. It left me calmer. Less stressed. The feeling of vague disconnection and lonliness I tend to carry with me and ignore -- like a limp I've gotten used to -- eased.

I don't know why, really. But it did.

So thanks, <a href="http://loachie.livejournal.com">loachie</a>. For what you wrote. And congratulations.
