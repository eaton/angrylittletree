<pre>
[Guy]  well a woman was killed in a car
       wreck like 2 miles from my house today
[Girl] did you see her ghost?
[Guy]  no that's not funny christina
[Girl] i didn't say it to be funny
[Girl] ghosts are awesome beings
[Guy]  actually they are a rather weak class
       of beings
[Girl] but they're awesome
[Guy]  i wish i had some mescaline
