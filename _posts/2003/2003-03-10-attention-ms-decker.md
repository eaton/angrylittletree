Wendys has placed, in my hands, the most scrumptious fast food burger I have ever consumed. The hot side is, in fact, hot. The cold side is, in fact, cold. Crunchy lettuce and firm, ripe tomato slices. Crispy bacon, not at all soggy. And a bun still fluffy with bun-like goodness.

I understand that this burger is an exception to the rule. But the gauntlet has been thrown down. McDonalds has some catching up to do.
