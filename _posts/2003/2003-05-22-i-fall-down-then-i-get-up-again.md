So it's sunny outside my window and I'm plodding through UML class diagrams and func spec documents. Life is good.

Tuesday, I played Ultimate Frisbee (an actual multiple-trips-up-and-down-the-field game) for the first time since last the ill fated Febuary midnight game. This time, I arrived early and killed time before everyone else showed up by jogging around the park for ten minutes or so, then stretching and drinking a bottle of water. I didn't think much of it, but later when the game started I went for quite a while without getting winded and/or cramping up. Wow! It's almost as if the advice everyone gives about this <i>warming up</i> business is accurate!

Very cool. I'll have to get into the habit...

Yesterday evening, after a day of meetings and architectural overviews with my vast crowd of coworkers, I crashed for an hour or so and napped in the sunbeam. I'm <i>tired</i> these days, and i can't figure out why. Maybe I should try getting more than 5 hours of sleep each night.  Got a haircut and chatted with Emily, My Stylist. The other day I stopped for a moment and realized that I've crossed a dark, scary line: <i>I have a hair stylist, and I know her by name.</i> What's next? Wearing ascots?

Hit the gym again after that -- while I'm still lifting completely whussy amounts, I'm sticking with <a href="http://mitomi.livejournal.com">mitomi</a>'s advice and developing 'muscle memory' at lower weights before trying to be all badass. This works out well, because I can't really be badass at the moment, even when I want to. Jogged half a mile to warm up, did three sets of twelve reps of four different exercises, then jogged another half a mile to relax afterwards and cooled off.

Drank Gatorade. Drove home. Ate sushi.

It was yummy.

This whole starting-to-get-into-shape thing is strange and surreal for me. I feel as if people will recognize that clearly I'm a fitness poseur, like someone who just now picked up a U2 CD for the first time. "Hey, man. Sunday Bloody Sunday is my favorite song!" Don't know if that makes any sense.

Ah, well. More func spec clarifications await me. Rar!
