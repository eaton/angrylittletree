<i>Lawrence may be a bum, but at the coffeehouse he's just one of the regulars. Every morning he taps his way down the street with that blind man's cane and joins us for a cup of something strong.

Fingers gnarled around his mug, he talks about tomorrow's weather -- he's never once been wrong. Today, he gives me a milky stare while I sip my decaf latte. I'm unsettled, with gooseflesh creeping up my neck. I ask him what he sees.

"Just wishin' I could change," he rasps, sad and slow. "Just wishin' I could change the things I see."</i>
