I want to be the kind of person that people mention to their friends -- "Hey, there's this really cool person that I know..."
I want to have a really kick-ass eulogy.
I want to be desired.
I want people to think that I am intelligent, and value my opinions.
I want people to feel safe around me.
I want to be accepted by others.
I do not want to say 'no' to other people.
I do not want to say 'no' to myself.
I want people to desire me because they know me, and enjoy the things that make me strange and odd and different.
I want to be strange and odd and different.
Paradoxically, I don't want to be excluded from the mainstream when I am lonely.
I want to change the world.
I want to be attractive.
I want to live in comfort.
I do not want to make hard decisions.
I am afraid of being alone.
I am afraid that I will hurt those who love me.
I am afraid that admitting I think I'm kind of cool, deep down, will jinx it.
I'm confused when people ask me if I love myself.
I never give straight answers to important questions.
I'm not afraid of committing, just of committing to the wrong thing.
I want to understand everything.
I'm afraid that if I did, I'd be responsible to fix things.

More to come, I'm sure.
