A few months back, I had a dream.

In my dream I'm at work, typing away in my cube. Specifically, I'm working on something involving the System.Drawing.Imaging namespace, and trying to figure out scaling values, but that really isn't important. The important part is that after a few minutes of that, I hear some kind of commotion around the entrance to the office. In walks a leggy redhead in a slinky dress.

Work with me here, people, it was a dream. I realize that I work at a web design company, and it's no longer 1999.

So said redhead walks up to me as I'm sitting there, and offers a smirk and some perfunctory greeting. At that point she leans down in this slinky dress and kisses me, hands on my shoulders.

So there I am, in my dream. What, humble reader, does my subconscious dish up at this point? Given this implausible but certainly interesting scenerio, what conclusion emerges from the depths of my psyche?

I blink, and I say to her, "Who the <i>hell</i> are you?" I stand up, walk out of the office, get into my car, and drive to Quizno's. I order a sub and I sit there eating it. I think to myself, "Man. This is a <i>really</i> good sandwich." And then I wake up.

I love being me.

Oh, yes, and a <a href="http://userpic.livejournal.com/4687232/168150" target="_blank">new user picture</a>. Three cheers for the new camera!
