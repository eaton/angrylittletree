<i>I found me a reason
So check me tomorrow
We'll see if I'm leaking
Push and push and push till it hurts
My devil's on rollerskates
Down at the roller rink
Picking up chicks for me
Ones that push and push and push till it hurts
Push and push till it hurts 
<!--break-->
Dirty enough I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Dirty enough I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad

Life's for the living
So check me tomorrow
We'll see if I'm kidding
Push and push and push till it hurts
Did it on Ritalin
I got me some good grades
Now I work me the night shift
Where I pull and pull and pull till it hurts
Pull and pull till it hurts 

Dirty enough I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Dirty enough I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad 

Hello time bomb, I'm ready to go off 

If life's for the livid
Check me tomorrow
We'll see if I'm emperor
My devil's on sugared smacks
Down at the radio shack
We're turning shit into solid gold, solid gold 

Dirty enough I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad
Dirty it enough I got me a love
And it's so bad, it's so bad 

Hello time bomb, I'm ready to go off
Hello time bomb, I'm ready to go off.</i>
