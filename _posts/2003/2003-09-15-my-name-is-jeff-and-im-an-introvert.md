It's odd to wake up on Monday morning and realize that you haven't really connected with a particular circle of friends in two weeks. As of a couple of months ago, we were hanging out, meeting up, and doing stuff almost every night of the week for a long, long time.

Lately, though, I've felt tapped out. Like my stockpile of social emotional energy is empty, and I can only manage short bursts of relating before I turn into a hermit again. The last month or two has been, at best, pretty taxing. A lot of work stress, tons of personal and relationship issues to sort through, friends in crisis, and other assorted ups and downs. I'm not complaining by any means -- things are still good for me and I have <i>tons</i> to be thankful for, and nothing truly bad has happened to me.

Dealing with all of this stuff though, rolling with the metaphorical punches, has left me stuck in ultra-introvert mode again. My tolerance for casual social interaction -- smalltalk, mingling, stuff like that -- is nonexistant. I walk away from conversations rather than feign an interset in bantering. A sense of deep existential dread creeps over me at the thought of chatting about work and the weather and current events. A few friends -- mostly people I've known for years and years, people I know I'm on the same page with and don't need to Be Socially Adept For -- are the ones I find myself wanting to connect with at the moment. Like cold water. It's not that I don't want to see or connect with all the other people I know and care about... I just find myself feeling emotinoally exhausted every time I think about it. As if the energy that would be necessary to 'psych up' for it is immense.

My creative energy's nonexistant -- I can come up with ideas, jot them down, but the follow-through isn't there. So I make notes and save them for a time when the zing returns.

I feel like I'm in a holding pattern at the moment. Maybe I'm just recuperating. That's what introverts do, isn't it?
