I'm getting about $6000 in insurance cash for my former-car. I wonder if that's taxable.

That'd kind of suck, since, y'know. I already paid taxes on the money when I earned it the first time around and paid for the car and all.

But hey, I'm not going to complain.

I might even be able to buy a new car, now!
