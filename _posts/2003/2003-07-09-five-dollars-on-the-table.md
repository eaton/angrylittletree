So we're all out at TGI Friday's after hanging out at Fusion. Our waitress, Tanya, was chatty and I was the one at the corner that was easily accessible from the aisle. So I ended up relaying orders in the noisy room, and chatting amicably while people figured out their orders. After a few such interactions, <a href="http://danaamor.livejournal.com">danaamor</a> and Cathy took it upon themselves to draw hearts around her name on my notebook and toss it over at me while she was taking the next round of orders. Tanya noticed. Asked if I had a crush on her. "No, but I know where <i>they</i> live..." She laughed.

They insisted that she was <i>flirting with me.</i> Not just flirting, but <i>really flirting.</i> Like, <i>interested flirting.</i> I pointed at them and laughed at them and coughed, and <a href="http://petey77.livejournal.com">petey77</a> sided with me. Go Petey! I got your back, bro.

First, I was not aware of the fact that I was being flirted with. I'm willing to chalk <i>that</i> up to my carefully cultivated obliviousness. But even if I <i>was</i>, experience has taught that things most people consider flirting do not mean <i>interest</i>. Vigorous disagreement ensued -- Cathy insisting that the waitress was <i>interested</i>, followed by my laughing. I slapped five bucks down on the table. She said she'd match it. If the waitress accepted a paper with my name and number on it, <i>Cathy</i> won. If not, <i>I</i> won.

I wandered off to the restroom and came back to the aftermath of Cathy's attempted matchmaking: apparently, our waitress Tanya  <i>did</i> think that I was quite funny and friendly and would love to get to know me <i>except</i> for the terribly inconvenient fact that she has a boyfriend. In other words, the socially gracious "No, I'm not interested." Cathy claimed that the answer constituted <i>half</i>interest, thus she didn't owe me the five bucks from the bet, but controversy reigned. I wrote a nice note telling Tanya not to blame the women at our table for the crazy antics, as they had only been off their meds for a few days.

What gives? Even to the bitter end, Cathy insisted that she <i>could pick these things up</i> and that the waitress <i>had been interested.</i> I don't think it's fair to project romantic interest onto other people when all they are really doing is being friendly, personable, and/or touchy-feely in socially acceptable ways. When someone's in a service industry, and their take-home pay essentially depends on how friendly and engaging they are with customers, I've always thought it's pretty narcissistic to pretend that those behaviors imply <i>romantic interest.</i>

Cathy insisted that this indicates <i>low self esteem</i> on my part, but I'm baffled. Isn't this the kind of situation guys always get flack for? Assuming that the waitress is keen on them because she's friendly? Suggesting that any socially gracious behavior indicates that a woman <i>has the hots for them?</i> That's just silly. And it's very strange to have someone essentially telling me that I <i>should</i> start doing that.

<a href="http://petey77.livejournal.com">petey77</a> suggested that women be issued flare guns, to be fired into the air to indicate romantic interest. I am completely in favor of this proposition. My baseline assumption in all situations is, "No, she's not interested. She's just being friendly." This assumption has never failed me. Either the woman turns out to be uninterested, or was only interested in an abstract, "If I were single, I would..." sort of way. Why not just assume thay they're not and get on with the process of getting to know people as fellow human beings?
