Nothing hits the spot for me like coffee in the morning, sun coming through the blinds, and a close shave. Don't know what it is about that combination, but it works for me and I feel all right about the world.

Thanksgiving was good -- I spent it with the family, had turkey and all the fixings, and we got a chance to watch a movie, <a href="http://www.kumquat.com/cgi-kumquat/funagain/01167" target="_blank">play a board game</a>, hang out and talk into the wee hours about philosophy and theology. That's the kind of stuff we do, see. It was good.

On the down side, my cell phone, long in the tooth at 3.5 years of age, finally bit the dust. Its LCD screen had been on the fritz for a while, it wasn't picking up calls very well, and it had a distressing tendency to turn off spontaneously and refuse to turn back on. It was a <i>troubled phone.</i> So. A quick trip to the Sprint PCS store, and I walked away with a svelte, shapely new phone that does more than my PalmPilot used to. I can now take photos, check my email, search google, send video clips to friends, and make coffee using my phone. When I receive voicemail, Softcell's <i>Tainted Love</i> plays in its entirety. Gratuitous excess is the name of the game, my friends.

Saturday night, I saw <i>The Last Samurai</i> with <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=petey77"><img height="17" border="0" src="http://www.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="petey77" align="absmiddle" width="17"></a><b><a title="" href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/petey77/">Petey</a></b>, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=blaster151"><img height="17" border="0" src="http://www.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="blaster151" align="absmiddle" width="17"></a><b><a title="" href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/blaster151/">blaster151</a></b>, and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=danaamor"><img height="17" border="0" src="http://www.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="danaamor" align="absmiddle" width="17"></a><b><a title="" href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/danaamor/">Dana</a></b>. I wasn't expecting a lot from it, to be honest -- I'm not much of a Tom Cruise fan, and my skepticism of any pre-hyped &quot;epic&quot; film is considerable. After watching, though, I was grudgingly impressed. I liked it a lot, and it prompted a lot of pondering and contemplation on subjects like <i>being vs. doing</i> and the nature of <i>quality</i>. Fun stuff, that.. I'm sure I'll be posting more later.
