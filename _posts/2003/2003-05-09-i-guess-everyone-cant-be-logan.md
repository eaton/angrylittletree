You are a very effective teacher, and you are very<br>committed to those who learn from you.  You put<br>your all into everything you do, to some extent<br>because you fear failure more than anything<br>else.  You are always seeking self-improvement,<br>even in areas where there is nothing you can do<br>to improve.
