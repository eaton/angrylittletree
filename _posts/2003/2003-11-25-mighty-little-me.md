Funny how it ebbs and flows -- sometimes making choices about who I want to be, and realizing what that means, can be a heavy thing. Disheartening. Depressing.

Other times, like today, it fills me with an inexplicable sense of adventure. A big shit-eating grin as I lean into the wind, and all that. Maybe it really is all about keeping my eyes on the prize, so to speak: being the kind of person I want to be. It snaps into place like a magic eye picture, and everything's right.

I like moments like that.
