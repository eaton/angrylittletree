<b><a href="http://therachel.livejournal.com">therachel</a> -- How many times have we hung out? alternate question: would you ever date anyone under 2 feet tall?</b>
I would estimate that since we first met at Cornerstone, we've chilled in various capacities around 18-24 times. It's hard to remember the details, though, as there are lots of parties we've both ended up at...

<b><a href="http://travellingstar.livejournal.com">travellingstar</a> -- Hm. What is your biggest strength? And, along the same line, your ultimate weakness?</b>
Probably the same thing. I've worked hard at being open-minded. Even if I disagree with someone, I do my best to listen to them honestly and legitimately consider their perspectives. 

<b><a href="http://jennafish.livejournal.com">jennafish</a> -- Why do most movie sequals get progressively worse? (with the exception of LOTR)</b>
Really good films tend to center around a unique idea, or a new twist on a common theme. Although some sequels are a natural, planned progression of the story, most are an attempt to capitalize on the success of the first film. If said first film was popular because of its new, fresh flavor then a second film will have the difficult task of satisfying existing fans while preserving the 'uniqueness.' Witness <i>The Matrix: Reloaded</i>, as well as <i>Police Academy 4.</i>

<b><a href="http://rakosha.livejournal.com">rakosha</a> -- did i ever really spin you out, onMOO ... ?</b>
Spin me out? Nawww. I'm pretty hard to rattle.

<b><a href="http://treechunk.livejournal.com">treechunk</a> -- do you think you could live at an Amish technological level?</b>
I believe I could. I'm better at all-or-nothing transitions than gradual ones. I'm not sure I could hack, say, going without the Internet because it's such an integral part of how I work and use a computer now. Going without computers entirely seems a little easier.

<b><a href="http://cottonmanifesto.livejournal.com">cottonmanifesto</a> -- Why won't our color printer collate its output?</b>
Print a Configuration page to verify configuration, and doublecheck your Print Setup options under the File menu. Recent versions of the HP Printer driver have changed the location of the collation options.


<b><a href="http://ddukbokki.livejournal.com">ddukbokki</a> -- Can you explain that again?</b>
OK, <i>one</i> more time. Because my unit has single-use infiltrate, I can move it twice its normal speed value into your territory during setup. Because of the April '03 ruling on infiltrate, though, your Mech can only move its normal speed value on infiltrate -- not double. I'd suggest using one or two light artillery units to force the infiltrating unit out of its prime spot, and possibly pin down advancing infantry.

<b><a href="http://ineedanewex.livejournal.com">ineedanewex</a> -- So son, do ya spank it?</b>
<i>Fox the fox
Rat the rat
You can ape the ape
I know about that
There is one thing you must be sure of
I can't take any more
Darling, don't you monkey with the monkey
Monkey, monkey, monkey
Don't you know you're going to shock the monkey?</i>


<b><a href="http://sprockette.livejournal.com">sprockette</a> -- how do you keep that bookshelf from sliding as your apt. seems to be on an incline?</b>
Staples. Lots and lots of staples. They're useful for all sorts of household projects!
