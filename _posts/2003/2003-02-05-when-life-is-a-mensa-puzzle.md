Via Instant Messenger:

Benson: Where are you with your quotebook when you're needed?!
Benson: Paul (apparently referring to nonvegetarian impulses at dinner): "[Incriminating quote deleted to protect the potentially innocent]"
Benson: I think it was LotR-related, but we gave him hell for it.

[Time passes]

Paul: Just thought you should know that ANYTHING that Benson tells you regarding last night and any quotes that may have occurred during said night are one hundred percent FALSE.  That is all.

[Time passes]

Benson: Don't believe anything Paul says.
the verb: Wait a minute, I think I've heard this conversation in a Mensa book before!
Benson: lol
