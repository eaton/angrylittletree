There's a woman on the train across from me, a level below. I can't see her face, but her hands are young. She's pulled a laptop from her bag and is starting it up -- looks like Windows 2000. A British Petroleum logo is her wallpaper - I'm sure it's where she works. Outlook 2000. That's what she's opening now, probably answering messages on the way hom. A salt-and-peppered fiftysomething man is slouched in the seat across from me, wearing jeans and old sneakers. He looks dazed. An art student and her friend juggle cell phone calls and laughter: it occurs to me that girls who wear glasses get an immediate +4 bonus on their charisma roll, regardless of the situation.

Hooked up in the city with <a href="http://fur.livejournal.com">fur</a>, <a href="http://jessypie.livejournal.com">jessypie</a>, <a href="http://joanofarrgh.livejournal.com">joanofarrgh</a>, <a href="http://rubypython.livejournal.com">rubypython</a>, and <a href="http://unclebrett.livejournal.com">unclebrett</a>... Much fun was had, mostly ordering taco and cheeseburger pizza, discussing the Fun And Zany Adventures that <a href="http://rubypython.livejournal.com">rubypython</a> has had thus far on her trip to Chicago, and so on. I was given 1960's harlequin romance novels. About nurses. I'm flattered that they know me well enough to understand how much I love kitsch.

<i>I</i> should start a bohemian art colony.

Also, Chester the cat and Max the cat amused themselves with ballpoint pens. Pens are clearly dangerous, dangerous creatures that must be attacked on sight. Stalked and hunted, even.

And so the evening was good.
