Mmmph. Good day.

Popped in to work, acclimating slowly but surely to this strange and surreal "normal hours" business. It feels pretty good to have actual work done by noon. Most of the stuff I'm doing is digging in and leaning about the framework that our apps are based on -- it's pretty solid, though remnants of the original architect's apparent obsessive-compusive style still show throuhg sometimes. Entire pages of XML-formatted comments for 6-line C# functions. What sense does <b>that</b> make? None, I tell you. None.

But, good stuff going on and it's definitely cool to work with <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a>. We're sharing an office, and the surrealness approaches sitcom levels.

After work, hooked up with the aforementioned <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> and <a href="http://danamoore.livejournal.com">danamoore</a>; had scrumptious New York Sirloin at Rock Bottom, then walked over to see The Matrix: Reloaded again. It was the second time for all of us, and we spent a good chunk of time analyzing the dialogue with The Architect for clues and arguing over possible interperetations. If anyone on my friends list hasn't seen it yet, get cracking. I'm not sure I can hold off spoilers much longer. I know a couple of you (cough<a href="http://shig23.livejournal.com">shig23</a>cough) didn't like it, so I'll try not to bore you with the details. *grin*

After that, headed across the street to the gym.

It was a strange experience -- I'm in terrible shape, admittedly. While I entertain no fantasies about becoming buff and cool and sexy (I think the universe would implode if that happened), I want to get in better shape. I'd like to play a full game of ultimate frisbee, for example, without dying. So I've got a membership at the gym near work, and tonight was my first attempt to cash in. I jogged for about twenty minutes, long enough to work up a sweat, cooled down, then attempted some sort of arm-curl-related weight thingie.

Wow. Those machines <i>are</i> designed to work specific muscle groups. Even the ones that I didn't realize I had and never bothered using.

Must die now, yes.

But at least it's a good kind of death that feels good as I fall asleep. I think I'm going to give it another shot tomorrow.
