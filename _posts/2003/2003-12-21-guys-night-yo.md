So <a href="http://www.fusioncentral.net" target="_blank">The Ladies Of Fusion</a> had their thing last night, getting together for chick flicks and whatever else they do when they have a "ladies' night." I like to think of myself as a pleasantly gender-neutral sort of person in interests and affinities, but the idea of a "Ladies' Night" still leaves me in the dark. It's a closed-door event, surrounded by the sort of mystery and hushed secrecy normally reserved for cult initiation rituals.

Those probably don't have John Cusack movies, though.

In any case, <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> and I decided to host an alternative for <i>the guys.</i> <a href="http://pfbishop7.livejournal.com">pfbishop7</a>, <a href="http://petey77.livejournal.com">petey77</a>, <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a>, and spooner all made it, so we had a nice sized group. There was much pizza, there was much Guy Stuff, and spooner brought over a fresh pre-release screening copy of Kill Bill on DVD. It was in PAL format rather than NTSC, though... so much geekery was involved as we wired the PC up to the TV and used fresh software to view the disc, even thoughthe normal DVD player wouldn't take it.

<a href="http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet" target="_blank">We are l337</a>. Hear us roar.

Seriously, though, it was an awesome time. Spooner's cool, and <a href="http://humblepen7.livejournal.com">humblepen7</a> startled him by having baked brownies to celebrate his birthday at the last minute. We work fast, yo. The evening wound down with long discussions of high school geeking memorieswhile listening to good music and watching winamp visualizations on the big screen.

All told, it was a lot of fun and we've decided we're going to have to do it again.
