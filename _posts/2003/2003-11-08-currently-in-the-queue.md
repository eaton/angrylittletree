<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1587430509/qid=1068315696/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-5156063-9551806?v=glance&s=books" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1587430509.01._PE20_PI_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" border="1"></a>So I've been reading a new book that I snagged at the Willow Bookstore, and I'm loving it. <i>Live To Tell: Evangelism for a Postmodern Age</i> is a great treatment of pomo culture for Christians willing to chew on the actual philosophical side of it, rather than a bullet-list of 'evangelism talking points.' The author explores pomo as a background for culture, and discusses how it impacts the way Christians can and do communicate with a culture whose core beliefs about the world differ. Respectful of those who don't share Christian perspectives without being wishy-washy. It's a tough balance for some authors, but Kallenberg manages it nicely. Very yummy and crunchy so far.

I haven't been listening to discrete <i>CDs</i> for a while now -- <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> and I finally finished ripping our respective CD collections to the music server and we now have 40 days and 40 nights of MP3 goodness streaming over the network. It means that whipping up a comp to suit my mood is a 15 minute process again, and the idea of 'album continuity' has been tossed out the window and forgotten. I'm loving it.

I think I feel like some classical suddenly... time to grep for mozart.
