I think the last several days of Livejournal entries are proof that friends do not, in fact, let friends post after 2am. It's just bad. Nothing good can come of it. To those who read my rants, you have my sincerest apologies. I do not, however, regret the photos that were posted. I stand by my belief that they were in fact quite swanky.

Thus, I will post more photos. They're low quality snapshots quickly and gracelessly scaled down for LiveJournal posting. Enjoy. Or don't, depending on your preference.
