I'm tired.

Tired of caring about love. My head wrote it off a long, long time ago, my heart's just slow on the uptake.

Yeah, yeah. Another whiny emo-boi post about lost love and how my heart is like the autumn leaves, right? It's okay, I don't mind if you skip this one. It's a <i>classic</i> LJ post, in the "I don't care who reads it, I'm just writing it to get it out in words" style.

<lj-cut text="Consider yourselves warned.">It's so easy to slip into cynical barbs or smirky, snarky humor. "If love is in the air, give me a gas mask," and things like that. But cynicism, as I've always said, is nothing more than the last desperate refuge of a frightened romantic. I suppose that'd be me, wouldn't it? Frightened by the knowledge that there is only more pain in the future. It doesn't keep me from marching on, from soldiering forward in the grand experiment that I call 'pursuing goodness,' but I try to be realistic. I know that doing what I do will not bring me happiness. I will not get the girl. I will not find love, at least not in that soft-focus disney film romantic love sort of way. It's not in the cards as best as I can tell, and the things I do, the way I live, only make the odds worse.

Sometimes it seems easier to cultivate a sense of emotional masochism than to figure out how to find happiness in ways consistent with my principles and beliefs. So I've been busy becoming an existentialist, at least when it comes to love. For full-on moral frameworks, I think it's still a bit wanting.

I have a long and unbroken chain of mundane and spectacular failures at attempted relationships. I have never once in my life asked a woman out successfully. Twice women <i>said yes</i> but something came up later. So, a career average of zero, perhaps with bonus points for a year-long unhealthy long distance relationship with the woman went on to get engaged to my best friend from high school and college.

This could be simply bad luck. But rule number one of relationships is, if a problem keeps happening, the only constant is <i>you.</i> Who I am and how I live and the choices I make -- those are the things responsible for my circumstances, not capricious gods or something like that.

I understand that there are other people who have been and are interested in relationships with me; I'm not on some go-eat-worms trip about no one loving me. I understand that if I were to change my definition of an acceptable relationship, one that I want to pursue, I <i>would</i> in fact be with someone. I choose my state, and I've no right to complain about it.

I think I've run out of steam now. I'll come back and update this entry when I feel like it. Now, I'm just too tired of it to care whether or not I finish the entry.
