Good weekend overall, with much sleep deprivation. Rar. It was, though, truly packed.

After shuffling and errands and emergency microwaving of cheese mancotti on Friday, I tried to sort out the last niggling details of my soon-to-be-former BankOne account. They're not bad people, really. I just love the local Credit Union so. And alas, there's only room for one financial insitituation in my life. After some waffling and introspection, I decided to check out the local Mechwarrior: Dark Age tournament venue. Every friday night, they have a nice two hour slugfest complete with awards and standard campaigns.

I was annihilated. Thrashed. Really, really pounded to tiny little pieces. 450 points to 0. Maybe more, I lost track once the opposing player had eliminated all my heavy armor and was capturing individual infantry units for extra points... Needless to say, it was a crushing defeat. I learned a lot, though, and my opponent was kind enough to give advice on where I'd let things fall apart, and what I'd done right before crumbling.

Saturday, met up with the Fusion crew to handle logistical planning for the weekend outing on the 28th. We're all going up to a camp in Wisconsin, renting a couple cabins, and playing Freezing People Who Have Fun Despite Not Being Able To Feel Their Extremities! It should be pretty cool, both literally and figuratively.

<a href="http://www.cekta.com/M242" target="_blank">Problem19</a> and <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> cruised on over after that meeting, and a long night of pizza, anime, and crazy Mech action. Prototypical Guys' Night with Cowboy Bebop and old 50's lounge playing in the background. In the end, we learned (once again) the value of properly screening armor with infantry and always, always making sure your Mech doesn't overheat.

Laughing, pizza consumption, and collapse-for-sleep followed, as the sun peeked over the horizon.

And it was good.
