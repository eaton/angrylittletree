random roundup time. I'm about 50% through implementing the first version of Preppy, a file processing utility I've been writing in .Net for the past couple of months. (An hour here, an hour there... eight hours in one sitting last night...) It's a basic UI, and a collection of interfaces and class libraries that implement an expandable plug-in aware file processing architecture. It's pretty easy to implement once you get the concept down, and it's exciting how much simpler everything becomes when you can break down things like directory renaming, image scaling, and so on into discrete implementations of the <pre>ProcessItem(string fileName)</pre> function. Geeks reading might want to check out <a href="http://www.dotnetforums.net/t49597.html" target="_blank">this article</a> for a helpful overview of some of the issues related.

And also, there was a washing machine related mishap a couple of weeks ago that left me testing the flexibility of my clothing collection. You know you're a bachelor when you start using <i>every piece of clothing you own</i> instead of going to the laundramat. At some point I dipped into the business casual stock near the back of the closet, and I think I've gotten hooked on it. I forgot how nice being snappily dressed feels: it contributes in a very tangible way to my sense of Badassness.

Maybe it's time to be daring and get a fourth pair of shoes.
