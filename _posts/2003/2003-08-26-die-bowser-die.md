It's sad that so few people play real, honest-to-God platform games anymore. Are they becoming a niche, like Japanese dating games? That would be tragic. So many metaphors that resonate with my generation will pass into the darkness, lost forever.

Our internet connection at work today is flaky. As in, up-for-three-minutes-down-for-seven-minutes flaky. <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> and I discussed the tricky nature of this behavior, comparing it to a end-level boss in a platform arcade game. You have to time your emails carefully, to hit its windows of vulnerability, or they'll bounce off of him ineffectively.

"And then," <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> says, "The Internet flashes three times and shoots back at you."

Ain't that the truth.
