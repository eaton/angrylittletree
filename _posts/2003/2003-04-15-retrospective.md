So the weekend was a mad, mad rush of code and movies and concerts and laughter and Mechwarrior and commuting. I'm still getting my legs back under me.

<lj-cut text="*Additional Notes">

*Kung Phooey is a really, really hilarious film. I've seen a lot of indie dramas, but comedies seem to be rare -- usually the genre is so dependent on a recognizable name to deliver the punch lines that it seems impossible to "break in." The director/producer/writer of Kung Phooey did a stellar job, though. The film lampoons every classic 70's kung fu stereotype, from the <i>Token Black Sidekick</i> to the <i>Subservient Uncle Wong Who Owns A Dry Cleaning Business.</i> It's done with a light touch, a lot of self awareness, and some genuinely funny writing. Check out the web site and see if it's going to be playing any festivals near you. He's currently trying to work out a distribution deal -- if all goes well, we may see it in a few Actual Theaters soon. Rar!

**Heck yeah. Problem19 and I faced off with unfamiliar equipment after the movie -- his Euclid crew was in town and they'd brought their Mechs along for the ride. After they played a nice 300 point slugfest, they challenged us to play with the same battleforces and see who came out on top. I took some nasty hits early on, but cheated death more times than I can count with Danni Hague's most excellent Arbalast light mech. The tide turned, and when all was said and done I'd captured his mech and whittled away his support force. It all came down to a couple of lucky rolls, but I came out on top. Well played, on both sides.

***Cowboy Bebop rocks the hizzouse, thank you very much. I want to be Spike when I grow up.

****Don't listen to <a href="http://gundi.livejournal.com">gundi</a>. I didn't dance. Not even a little bit.
