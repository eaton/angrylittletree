So I caught <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/benditlikebeckham/" target="_blank">Bend It Like Beckham</a> with <a href="http://gundi.livejournal.com">gundi</a> last night after work. <b><a href="http://www.cekta.com/M242" target="_blank">Problem19</a></b> and I watched it a while back when it hit Chicago theaters, and it was fun to see it again. 

On the surface, it's similar to teen coming of age and "wacky ethnic family" films. A indian high school senior is frustrated by her Indian family's opposition to her soccer habits -- it's fine for kids but now that she's growing up she'll have to behave like a lady, etc etc. Although it's definitely funny, it seemed to have a lot more respect for both the traditions her family was struggling to hold onto, and the complexity of Jess's life and her atempts to negotiate family relationships and the Big World Out There. Unlike Greek Wedding, it spent less time playing up the "Hey, we're wacky ethnic people! Woo-hoo!" moments and let the colliding-culture moments draw laughs without forcing them. In the process, the family seemed a lot more human and their concerns for their daughter felt like more than simple "Marry a nice Indian boy and settle down" nagging.

Anyways. Good movie. Fun. Soccer. Yay.

One of the things that jumped out as I was watching it, though, had nothing to do with the plot... the guy who plays the coach of the girl's soccer team Jess joins is an actor by the name of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Rhys-Meyers,%20Jonathan" target="_blank">Jonathan Rhys-Meyers</a>. He's my age -- within a couple of weeks anyways -- and he's a really lanky, skinny fella, relatively speaking. Not a bodybuilder, at least. And that's one of the things that I've always been seriously conscious of about myself. I've got no sixpack. Biceps? Pecs? I've heard of those. I think I read about them once. I'm an angular, bony sort of guy by nature. When I wear a t-shirt, you can see that my arms are thin. You can see veins. It's a simple thing, but it's always clawed at the back of my psyche. I wear long-sleeved shirts whenever I can, and when I wear T-shirts I try to grab a long-sleeved shirt to put over them. Anything to keep a protective shield of fabric between The World Out There and The Body I Don't Like. The antibuff. The 90-pound guy that got pounded in high school, not that strong one that you respect.

So I'm sitting there in the dark watching this film, and we're laughing at the funny stuff and pondering the serious stuff and soaking in a quality piece of cinema -- and I notice that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers's sleeves are pushed up his arms as he's walking in one of the scenes. His arms, see. You can see veins.

It's such a simple thing but it hit me like a brick to the head. Can't really articulate how or why it affected me so much. But I've been thinking about it since.
