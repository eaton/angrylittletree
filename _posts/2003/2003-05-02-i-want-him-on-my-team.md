MSNBC is carrying <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/908232.asp?0cv=NB10&cp1=1" target="_blank">a story about a hiker in Colorado</a> who was pinned under a 1,000 pound boulder. For those not familiar with weights and measures, that's like accidentally dropping a Hyundai on your left arm.

I'll let the story's summary speak for itself: <i>Pinned by a boulder for five days and having run out of water, a climber amputated his own arm with a pocket knife, rappelled down a cliff and walked until rescuers found him.</i>

Dude. I want this guy on <i>my</i> team.
