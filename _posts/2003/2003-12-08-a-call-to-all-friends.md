Those of you who know me have probably been subjected, at some point, to <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/teaser.html" target="_blank">Havana Moderne</a>, my ongoing side project of doom. The current installment of it will require some 3D rendering work -- in particular, shots of a fictional VR world, kind of like a visual MOO or MUSH. Not too detailed -- most of it would consist of inside-a-simple-room shots of two avatars talking.

The problem is, my 3D skills atrophied back in the mid 90's after playing with Infini-D 2.0 for the Mac. Is there anyone out there who'd be interested in playing along with this project and working on some of the 3D art?
