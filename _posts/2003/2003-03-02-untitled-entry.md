I'm being actively punished by my own thighs. My shoulders and back are in on it, too, but I think my thighs are definitely the ringleaders. I didn't know cramps and bruises could be layered so effectively.

Back In The Day, as they say when they're being pretentious, I used to do epic blow-by-blow travelogues. Road trips, music fests, hell... days off work all got the Kerouc treatment. I've gotten out of that habit, and I think it's for the better. Every so often, though, I wish I had the energy and drive to maintain that kind of running narrative. This weekend was one of those every-so-oftens.

<i>For those who're out of the loop, or who haven't read for subtext in the last few months of messages, I help coordinate a wacky, messy spectacle of a Bible Study/Singles Group/Etc. called <a href="http://www.fusioncentral.net" target="_blank">Fusion.</a> I spent a decade or so of my life oscillating between optimism, frustration, and antagonism regarding connection and honesty in the Christian community... Fusion has, for the past year-and-then-some, been an opportunity to me to help Do It The Way I Think It Should Be Done. Fight Club: The Bible Study. Etc. etc. In any case, the people in the group -- and especially the other crazy goons who co-lead the group -- have become some of my closest and dearest friends over that time. It's good stuff.</i>

So, as I was saying.

My body is punishing me for this weekend.

I think somewhere between the 20-something-degree ultimate frisbee at midnight, the volleyball, the basketball, and the sprinting-in-the-dark-to-ditch-the-girls-in-the-woods-for-fun... Somewhere around there, whenever my brain said, 'Yo, I need some help moving around quickly and such,' my body stopped producing endorphines and just started pointing and laughing. Now, for some reason, it hurts to stand up and, sometimes, to raise my arms above my shoulders. But what a time it was.

Friday after work, a number of the Fusion crew (14 of us in fact) migrated up to Wisconsin to spend the weekend at camp. Fun stuff, with nothing but sleeping bags and large sacks full of jellybeans. <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> and I bummed rides with <a href="http://gundi.livejournal.com">gundi</a> in her swanky 4-wheel-drive SUV, and were generally Bad Bad People once night fell. When you're lost in the foggy depths of rural Wisconsin and the sun goes down, pretty much everything starts to look like the set of a bad 80's horror movie. We of course made every attempt to point this out to her. Around the time Country Road H inexplicably turned into County Road C, and we couldn't find the Drive or Avenue or Lane we were hunting for, we started making comments about how funny it was that we were, what, three young singles driving through the middle of nowhere at night, trying to find a strange summer camp where we'd be spending time with our friends, and didn't that sound just like a story you've heard somewhere, and -- hey, did you see those trees move?

Stopping at the seedy roadside bar for directions was a nice touch -- but when <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> jumped back in the SUV and said, tense, "Drive! Just drive!"  The screaming and flooring-it-to-exit-the-parking-lot-at-60mph was truly, truly priceless. Even better was the attempt to turn around a few minutes later, and the subsequent realization that we were attempting to turn around <i>in a cemetary at the side of the road.</i> More screaming and acceleration ensued.

I, for one, consider it proof of <a href="http://gundi.livejournal.com">gundi</a>'s saintliness that she didn't try to kill me in my sleep with a fork as payback for all the scaring we did.

But that's only the trip to get there, and I promised myself I wouldn't turn this into the Extended Director's Cut, didn't I?

Other high points of the weekend include the miraculous, fantastic come from behind victory in ultimate frisbee... I like to think it's especially impressive considering that <a href="http://humblepen7.livejournal.com">humblepen7</a> and I were playing in T-shirts for the last two points. Thank God we didn't go through with the we'll-play-skins idea... 30 degrees is just a <i>tiny</i> bit nippy, see... Seriously, though. Fusion plays rough. I lost count of the collisions, body checks, and general Really Hard Defense. I was tackled from behind in the end zone when Dave decided that I Really Shouldn't Catch That Frisbee. Fun stuff!

When we all retired to the bunkhouse and got the fire roaring, <a href="http://jennafish.livejournal.com">jennafish</a> and <a href="http://jefner1.livejournal.com">jefner1</a> kicked off the 'Encouraging Each Other' theme. It was carried through the entire weekend -- opportunities to express appreciation for each other, drop notes to each other with encouragement, etc... It was strange. I'm generally twitchy about things that seem like Forced Appreciation, or Artificial Expressions Of Care And Interest... Those who know me will immediately understand what I mean when I say that I dodge compliments like Keanu ducking Agent Smith. I cringe at the idea of socially-enforced-expressions-of-interest. I would rather be ignored than humored, you know? I'd rather be unnoticed than have people feel obligated to compliment me, lest I Feel Bad. Yeah. Anyhow, I'm twitchy about stuff like that. Very.

But it's strange... Strange how eventually, it gets through the defense mechanisms. Hearing people you know and care for telling you things that they appreciate about you... Hearing them say, with everyone there listening, what it is they see in you, and admire, or enjoy, or what not... Hearing it over and over from different people and different angles and different perspectives... It sinks in. Eventually that voice in the back of your head that says, 'Yeah, sure, they <i>have to say that</i>' quiets down. Moments like those are scary, mostly because they force me to admit that it matters to me. Matters that the people I konw, and care about, and want to grow closer to, appreciate me. Know me. Recognize my unique qualities. Matters that they <i>want</i> me around, rather than simply accepting my presence.

So... yeah.

Yeah, it was definitely a kicker.

The rest of the stuff -- the Huge Manly Bonfire <a href="http://humblepen7.livejournal.com">humblepen7</a> and I crammed into the too-small fireplace, the exploring the woods in the middle of the night, the jokes, the laughter, the pain and the exertion -- it all fades away when I zoom out and see the weekend's big picture.

I love you guys.

Fusion: It's The Good Kind Of Pain.
