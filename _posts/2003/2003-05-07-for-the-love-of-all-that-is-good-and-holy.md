Remember <a href="http://www.eHarmony.com" target="_blank">eHarmony</a>? That scariest of web sites created by Dr. Niel Clark Warren, Noted Christian Relationship Expert? A word to the wise: no matter how funny it is at the time, never sign up for the site as a joke. It's like giving a telemarketer your social security number.

Every day, it's email about how I should join, because I'll be deliriously happy -- or a note informing me that they've "set me up" with a Mary Kay Cosmetics Consultant from Wisconsin named Lindsey, and we'd get along smashingly, and I should drop her a line... Or the administrative assistant named Alicia from Chicago who likes "sincere people" and "Jesus." We'd surely hit it off, Dr. Warren assures knowingly in his Personal Email To Me.

Dear God.

<i>Every day.</i>

I'm sorry, peope. I've learned my lesson! No more jokes! I mean, come on! I listed my hobbies as 'Cheetos, snow pants, and taking over South America by force.' I listed my most remarkable characteristic as 'Vestigal gills.'

Who <i>responds</i> to a profile like that?
