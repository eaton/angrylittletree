<i>"Good morning! I made a markov chainer while you were asleep!"</i>

I have cool friends. That's all.

Also, in the 'scary freaky embarassing' moment of the day, I'm getting ready to hop into the shower when, out of the corner of my eye, I see a human figure standing at the bathroom door. I jump, reflexively, and then after a picosecond of raw panic realize that it's the slacks and shirt I hung on the towel hook.

Um. Yes.

My name is Jeff, and I'm frightened by clothes.
