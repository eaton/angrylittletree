...Well, not all night. But I crashed around nine and fell asleep where I sat -- woke up at 12:30 with a phone call, and goodness. I can't get backto sleep to save my life. So I poped in the DVD version of <i>Neverwhere</i> by Neil Gaimain. It's a BBC production, so it's got a quirky charm to it... I can't help thinking though that a book as sweeping as <i>Neverwhere</i> really does deserve the kind of production values that a big-budget flick can bring.

Makes me wonder how his other work would fare on the big screen -- I'd love to see a movie treatment of <i>Stardust.</i> It'd be halfway between The Princess Bride and The Dark Crystal, I think.
