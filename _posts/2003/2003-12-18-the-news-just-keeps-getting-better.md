Those who've been following sports and/or feminist news know about the Chrysler Lingere Bowl, scheduled for the Superbowl halftime show. It was to consist of a bunch of lingere models dressed up in shoulder pads, panties and bras tackling and wrestling each other. Sort of like a lesbian BudBowl. After a great hue and cry from the public, <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20031218/od_nm/autos_daimlerchrysler_lingerie_dc_3&cid=573" target="_blank">they finally cancelled their sponsorship.</a> Hooray!

ProteinOS mentioned the <a href="http://feed.proteinos.com/001790.html" target="_blank">successful test flight of an unmanned spacecraft</a> this week. It's a privately funded venture, and probably won't be the last. I think it's only a matter of time, though, before the government and military start placing major limitations on what individuals and 'unblessed' corporations can do in this realm. The US military is always looking for new 'high ground,' and space is where the action will be.

In the hypocrisy department, we have news of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/12/15/thurmond..paternity/index.html" target="_blank">Strom Thurmon's illegitimate black daughter</a>...

Columnist William Pfaff argues that <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/121875.html" target="_blank">Saddam's capture bodes ill for Bush's re-election</a>. Why? Resistance fighters in Iraq have been operating for a while now, and it seems unlikely that Saddam was "behind it all" from his little bomb shelter hidey-hole. Now Iraqi nationals who oppose the US presence can fight back without fear of being branded Saddam loyalists. Additionally, "with Saddam gone," he says, "the Shiite authorities are free to express their real ambition: power in a new Iraq proportionate to their majority in the population." Cue conflict.
