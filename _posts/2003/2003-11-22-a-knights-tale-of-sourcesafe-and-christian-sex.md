A conversation with friends revealed my shocking secret -- I've never seen <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000F4ZY/jeffsquared-20">A Knight's Tale.</A> When it hit theaters, I didn't pay too much attention -- it sounded like the kind of testosterone-fest period action piece that... well... is a testosterone-fest period action piece. 'Nuff said, eh? Well, after recommendations from the same set of shocked friends that discovered my secret, I decided it might be something to check out. Here I am, debugging some file export code with Heath Ledger jousting and trying to learn to dance.

I think I like it. I'm wavering between seeing it as annoying, with the sort of obvious 'map current social mores onto a less progressive era' tricks that made Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman so laughable. Let's face it -- the Middle Ages were not a kind time for peasants, gender rights, or the concept of equality across social classes. While it makes fun cinema, and lets us see our current social mores as the realization of what peasants struggled for in centuries past, it's a sort of selective memory towards history.

But hey, when they start playing a Queen song for the jousting sequence, how can you not love it? Goeffrey Chaucer as the WWF-announcer prototype? I'm sold! I've decided to look at it as a <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001MXXE/jeffsquared-20">Clueless-Esque</A> story that's set in a particular era only coincidentally. The story itself is well-executed, and I like the shape of it. It explores the nature of pride, and love, and all that good stuff. I still reserve the right to grit my teeth when characters spout blatant 20th-century ideas in an age when those ideas would've been utterly and completely foreign. But, yeah. I'm liking the movie.

I very much dislike Visual SourceSafe, on the other hand. This occurs to me as it screams and whines and whimpers because I'm trying to work disconnected on a 35-project solution. That seems to be some kind of bonding experience for Windows developers, hating SourceSafe. Everyone either uses or has used at at some point, and everyone knows that the only thing worse than it is no source control at all. We're looking at better solutions at work right now -- we've hit that point where we really, really need a good system with solid branching support and less suckiness.

And speaking of sucking, it's time to talk about sex.

Random <a href="http://www.metafilter.com">metafilter</a> linkage took me to <a href="http://www.nomarriage.com">Nomarriage.com</a>, the ultimate site of male bitching and whining. It's essentially an extended rant about the evils of gender equality. It's a crackheaded piece of work by a guy who either needs to be slapped a lot, or is a genius troll.

The interesting thing, though, is that it linked to a site called <a href="http://www.themarriagebed.com/">The Marriage Bed</a> -- Christian Sex Advice. Needless to say, there aren't many of those around. There are even fewer that discuss sex beyond a few tentative stabs at <i>the importance of purity</i> and <i>dating advice.</i> Although Nomarriage is a laughable charicature of male bitterness, The Marriage Bed is startlingly cool. It makes no apologies for the moral principles that the authors feel are essential ot the Christian faith, and takes an honest and direct approach to exploring those principles in the context of sexuality and intimacy. It takes <i>balls</i> to write a Christian web site with a section on watersports and scat that looks honestly and objectively at the principles involved rather than a knee-jerk discussion of <i>naughtiness</i>. Although I may not agree with every conclusion they come to, I have the utmost respect for their willingness to carefully consider these things and apply Biblical principles to complex issues that most people simply ignore.

Hey!

Heath Ledger <i>does</i> get the girl in the end. Who would've guessed?
