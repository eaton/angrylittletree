Jeff Eaton says: indeeeeed.  I'm considering going out and getting it when i run errands tonight. help me be good, Issy.
Issa says: don't do it!
Jeff Eaton says: okay.
Issa says: you'll... be disappointed. 
Jeff Eaton says: really? I was thinking of going and reinstalling Max Payne 1 because I enjoyed it so much.
Issa says: it's not revolutionary, reviews say.
Jeff Eaton says: well.
Jeff Eaton says: it was about shooting things in slow motion. it's classic, like pie.
Issa says: mmmm, pie.
Jeff Eaton says: when you see a new pie, you don't complain that it's not *revolutionary*.
Jeff Eaton says: you say, 'Hey, pie. Is it yummy pie?"
Jeff Eaton says: and if it is, you say, "Mmmmm."
Issa says: um, well..
Jeff Eaton says: if it's bad pie, you say, "Eugh. Yuck."
Jeff Eaton says: Even though it's not particularly BETTER than the last pie you had, you say, 'Yeah. That was Good Pie.'
Issa says: i do.
Issa says: my mom makes pie! i say, "whoa! pie! what kind?" "apple" "oh... i was hoping for like, grape pie."</i>
