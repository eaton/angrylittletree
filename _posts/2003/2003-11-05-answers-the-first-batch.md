<b><a href="http://weds.livejournal.com">weds</a> -- Why didn't you tell me I was batshit insane back in the day? ^_^</b>
I wonder if it's a good thing or a bad thing that I didn't notice. I mean, my credulous-meter is rated very , very high. So I tend to just kind of roll with those things. The wacky spiritual aspects of things, well. That's a whole realm of looniness even before personal issues come into play, so I write it off entirely in the 'batshit loony' department. No way to avoid the looniness. :-j On other fronts, well. Yeah. Maybe I'm just TOO unruffleable?

<b><a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a> -- Are you really as sexy as everyone thinks?</b>
Yes. The rumors are true.

<b><a href="http://trinitystardust.livejournal.com">trinitystardust</a> -- when was the last time you saw something or heard something that made you think about me, if at all? and what was it that triggered it?</b>
A couple of days ago, actually. i was listening to Bleed American and thinkign about sushi, and it reminded me, alternately, of your birthday outing with friends and the Jimmy Eat World concert a year or two ago. We hung out at your apartment talking, and the assorted crew (Brett, Steph, etc) wandered in after the concert... Random associative memories, and all that goodness.

<b><a href="http://backburner.livejournal.com">backburner</a> -- Have you ever eaten roasted duck?</b>
Never once. I think I might've had a bit of duck once, but I rmember it being rich. Like, stupendously sick-to-my-stomach rich afterwards. I tend not to go for stuff like that unless it's baklava.

<b><a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> -- Which is your favorite cat?</b>
As much as I hate to pick favorites, Boogedy is my favorite. Neurotic and martyrish though she may be, she's a cutie and she purrs a lot.

<b><a href="http://fur.livejournal.com">fur</a> -- 5 cds you'd take with if you were stuck on a desert island the rest of your life...</b>
You are sick, sick, and evil for posting a question like this but i'll try to answer without cheating and saying that I'd take an MP3 compilation CD.

<b><a href="http://lapintada.livejournal.com">lapintada</a> -- Would you ever consider coming to NYC to take pictures of me for me?</b>
I'm generally pretty gunshy about meeting net.people I know in person. I've had some grim experiences in that category, and while I don't think the worst of people, I tend to be very very cautious and get to know people very well before seeing them face to face. That said, I'm a horrible sucker for photography (wow, what a shock..) If I were ever in New York I wouldn't rule out the possibility of hooking up at a park or something like that, and getting some cool shots. Three cheers for natural light and gritty street settings! Portraits rock.
