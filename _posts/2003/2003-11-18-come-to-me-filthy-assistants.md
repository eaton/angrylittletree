This Halloween, I was a slacker in the costume department. Sure, sure, I came up with a fun excuse -- I said I was a weapon of mass destruction and berated anyone who said I wasn't wearing a costume. "What? Come on, these things take time! The costume is <i>here!</i> You can't rush these things! This costume is based on the best intelligence available!" Three cheers for political snarkiness <i>very</i> thinly disguised as revelry.

But I was left dissatisfied. What, I wondered, would properly capture the insanity I prefer without requiring thousands of dollars in shaped aluminum and FX gear for a Tranzor Z costume? <a href="http://mitomi.livejournal.com">mitomi</a> offered the solution -- next year, I'm going as Spider Jerusalem, outlaw journalist of the future. Shave my head, use a fine-tip sharpie for all that tattoos, whip up a pair of Spider's custom specs... Yeah. It could work. The two-headed kitten would be easy, given a pair of stuffed animals and a sewing kit... And I've been meaning to pick up a black business suit.

Yeaaah.

Yeah, this could work nicely.
