		<td align="left" valign="top">Mmmmmm. Stirfry. I was very pleased with the results; they were quite yummy and the mix of peppers was as aesthetically pleasing as I'd hoped it would be. Next time around I think I want to go a little heavier on the flavoring (onions, garlic, soy sauce) while I'm doing the meat; while it was good, the flavor wasn't as rich as I prefer. But all in all, a great experiment. Yum.</td>
