People ask me, sometimes, for relationship advice. This baffles me, continually.

"Look," I tell them. "Let's get this straight. My advice will not get you the girl. My advice leads to <i>pain</i> and <i>personal growth.</i> If you're okay with that, by all means let's continue. But let's not pretend this is something it's not."

They laugh and think I'm joking. But come on, people. Look at me! Do you really want to be me?

As an unrelated side note, <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> tells me that Boogedy that cat sleeps outside my closed bedroom door every night, waiting for me to wake up. I'm not sure how I should feel about this. It's the first time I've had a stalker who wasn't even human.
