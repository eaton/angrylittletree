When the <a href="http://www.cato.org/dailys/07-31-03.html" target="_blank">Cato Institute</a> says Bush is a big spender who "panders like Clinton," you know things are getting grim...

In brighter news, an Austrian avian-wannabee became the first person to fly across the english channel without the benefit of an aircraft. <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/104775.html" target="_blank">His story,</a> fit for a Disney movie, also bears a bit of a <lj-cut text="resemblance to Operation Screaming Fist, straight from the pages of Neuromancer...">

You find anything?' she asked, her voice fuzzy with sleep and drugs.

`Tell you later,' he said, `I'm wrecked.'  He was hungover and confused.  He lay there, eyes closed, and tried to sort the various parts of a story about a man called Corto.  The Hosaka had sorted a thin store of data and assembled a precis, but it was full of gaps.  Some of the material had been print records, reeling smoothly down the screen, too quickly, and Case had had to ask the computer to read them for him.  Other segments were audio recordings of the Screaming Fist hearing.

Willis Corto, Colonel, had plummeted through a blind spot in the Russian defenses over Kirensk.  The shuttles had created the hole with pulse bombs, and Corto's team had dropped in in Nightwing microlights, their wings snapping taut in moon- light, reflected in jags of silver along the rivers Angara and Podhamennaya, the last light Corto would see for fifteen months.  Case tried to imagine the microlights blossoming out of their launch capsules, high above a frozen steppe.

`They sure as hell did shaft you, boss,' Case said, and Molly stirred beside him.

The microlights had been unarmed, stripped to compensate for the weight of a console operator, a prototype deck, and a virus program called Mole IX, the first true virus in the history of cybernetics.  Corto and his team had been training for the run for three years.  They were through the ice, ready to inject Mole IX, when the emps went off.  The Russian pulse guns threw the jockeys into electronic darkness; the Nightwings suffered systems crash, flight circuitry wiped clean.

Then the lasers opened up, aiming on infrared, taking out the fragile, radar-transparent assault planes, and Corto and his dead console man fell out of a Siberian sky.  Fell and kept falling...</i></blockquote>
