So <a href="http://venomgoddess.livejournal.com">venomgoddess</a> mentioned <a href="http://homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html" target="_blank">StrongBad</a>, and 30 minutes later I'm still clicking and laughing myself out of my chair. It's genius. It's like Space Ghost Coast To Coast meets Wil Wheaton's Blog. Or something. I'm not sure. Just click it. And... click stuff. And laugh!
