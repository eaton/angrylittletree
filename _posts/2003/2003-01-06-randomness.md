1) Mechwarrior: Dark Age is a sick, sick drug. Am spending an hour this evening scanning tactics guides on the net and learning all of the subtle and nifty uses of Clan Battle Armor units in supporting groups of three.

2) Dodge introduced their <a href="http://us.news1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20030106/i/1041889244.2214764637.jpg" target="_blank">Tomahawk</a> concept motorcycle at the Detroit Auto Show. It's a sexy looking little thing with a futuristic frame and the engine of a Dodge Viper. (!!!) Yes, that's right. The engine from a Dodge Viper. It can reach speeds of 400mph.

3) So I joined the <a href="http://www.eff.org" target="_blank">EFF</a>. It's the least I can do, since they're one of the only organizations that's actually getting out there and dealing with digital media and fair use issues. I'll also get a nifty T-shirt out of it.
