So <a href="http://joanofarrgh.livejournal.com">joanofarrgh</a> forwards this personals ad to me, laughing, and it was just too good not to share.

<b><i><a href="http://sanfrancisco.craigslist.org/about/best/8993046.html">socially maladjusted girl seeks geekboy for relationship abuse</a></i></b>
<i>Everytime I post one of these I get flooded with 30yrold+ men with steady jobs. I am 24 going on 16 and well on my way to getting fired for ircing all day. I want a fellow slacker who rarely leaves his bedroom, but who is also willing to break into abandoned warehouses with me at 3am on a Tuesday. I like scrawny geekboys between 21-27 that I can toss across the room. If you exercise in any regular way, we aren't going to work out, trust me. I have two cats named awk and grep. If you don't get the joke, don't reply. If you do get the joke, note that I am fucking hilarious...</i>
