What do you think God is, or is like?

I'm working on some art. I want to have a lot of text -- like, reams and reams of it -- used for texturing in the image. And I figure, why not have a lot of peoples' thoughts used for that?

So tell me your thoughts. All answers acceptable. You think God's the source of love and goodness? Tell me about it. Think it's a viral meme eating away at the core of humanity? Rant away.

I'm curious.
