Wow.

Those who know me know that I have quite a few domain names. I collect them. Trade them. Share them with friends. <a href="http://www.dotster.com" target="_blank">Dotster.com</a> is fundamentally dangerous mostly because it makes registering something like www.angrylittletree.com cheaper than a large pizza on a friday night -- definitely below the impulse threshold.

The problem, of course, is finding low-cost high-quality hosting providers to home the domains on. Having tried half a dozen hosting companies over the last few years and reviewed countless more, my experiences this morning with <a href="http://www.portalwebhosting.com/" target="_blank">Portal Webhosting</a> were nothing less than startling. They offer 500 megs of space, a 200 meg SQL Server 2000 database account, 12 gigs of transfer bandwidth, and full ASP.Net 1.0/1.1 support. Oh, and a nice webmail system, too. Their price is $25 a month - the same that I've been paying for one of my other sites, with far less forgiving options.

So I signed up and set the wheels in motion to migrate my domain over. Paypal'd the first payment to them and wandered off to take a shower.

With me so far? Here's where it gets interesting.

They <i>called</i> me. 15 minutes after I created the account, they called me on the actual phone, with voices and everything, to clarify some information about the new account and explain the options for it. I blinked. I'm used to a 24 hour wait followed by automated email tag and a desperate rush to get a support ticket. This isn't just web hosting, this is <i>the way it should be.</i> Now, not more than 30 minutes after sending in the order, the account is already set up all that's left for me to do is point the DNS record at it.

I'm floored. Amazed. Startled, and all that good stuff. So yeah. If you're looking for good ASP.Net hosting, definitely check these guys out. If you set up an account you'll also be helping support the open source <a href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com" target="_blank">DotNetNuke</a> project.

In other news, I took the "How Sexy Is Your Name" quiz that <a href="http://Pouk23.livejournal.com">Pouk23</a> mentioned. The only analysis it offered was: "<a href="http://www.wtv-zone.com/techniguy/names/J.html" target="_blank">You are totally f*cking marvelous!</a>" I was kind of confused, but hey! Who am I to argue?
