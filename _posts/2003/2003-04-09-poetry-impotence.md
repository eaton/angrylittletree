<i>(circa 1997. excellent example of the 'angsty teenager who can't write structured poetry' genre.)</i>

teasing
on my fingertips
sliping from my grasp

words betray me
mystify me
scatter like flies
                
buzzing laughter as i grope
mocking
my impotence

i hate my words
those stupid, simple words
tools too heavy for my hands

a cripple with a brush
a toddler with a gun
thought like arrows with no bow
