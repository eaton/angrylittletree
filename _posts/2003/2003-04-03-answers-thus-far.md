Questions from <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/poll/?id=120024" target="_blank">Poll #120024: Ask Predicate Anything</a> are rolling in. Answers posted as the questions are asked.

<a href="http://rubypython.livejournal.com">rubypython</a>  <b> asks, Is it possible, with earth's current technology, to build a full size and fully functional mech/CAV? If not, what planet could we do this on, and is world conquest an option after construction?</b>
Althouth certain Mech/CAV designs would be quite troublesome in combat situations with current technology, the concept is sound. <a href="http://www.plustech.fi/Walking1.html" target="_blank">PlusTech Industries,</a> a subsidiary of John Deere, has been building <a href="http://www.plustech.fi/images/ISOT/walk99big.jpg" target="_blank">multi-legged walkers</a> for industrial applications since the late 80's and early 90's. A <a href="http://www.plustech.fi/images/PDF/Walking-Brochure.pdf" target="_blank">full brochure</a> and <a href="http://www.plustech.fi/images/Wallpaper/Wallpaper1024x768.jpg" target="_blank">cool wallpaper images</a> are both available on the company's home page. Although the device would fall in the <i>heavy battle armor</i> range, rather than the <i>light mech</i> range, it's a clear indication that the technology is there, should we choose to harness it. Long live the republic!

<a href="http://venomgoddess.livejournal.com">venomgoddess</a> <b> asks, What are your plans for the next three years as far as where you will live, who (and how much) you will love and where you will work?</b>
Plans are pretty fluid at this point in life -- I'm preparing to move, working as a temp contractor, and I have a close circle of friends but no romantic relationship(s). I'd like to be here in the Chicago area -- I'm a homebody at heart, although I do love traveling. If I do move out of state, the west coast looks promising. The tech job market isn't too stellar from what I hear, but Mmmmmmm, mm! What a gorgeous place to live. Working... well. I'd like to be doing some coding on the side, because I enjoy it, but I'd like to spend at least a couple of years doing video production work. There are a couple of ideas I'm kicking around -- MPEGs may be appearing on a server near you. Who will I love in three years? Zounds. That's one that requires psychic powers, or more hope-and-dreaming than I'm willing to fess up to.

 <a href="http://spectrocity.livejournal.com">spectrocity</a> <b> asks, Why, in our walk with Christ, in order to become wise, must me first become foolish?</b>
I tend to think this paradox meshes well with postmodernism's emphasis on humanity's limited perspective and subjectivity. For hundreds of years, enlightened rationalism emphasized the necessity of certainty, of knowledge, of intellect. I believe it was Thomas Acquinas who advanced the idea that man's will was corrupted in the Fall, but not his intellect -- meaning that a completely rational understanding of the totality of the Gospel was possible. Although reason and intellect are important tools, I believe our limited frame of reference as temporal, finite beings makes them far less than perfect for The Big Questions. It can become a point of pride for us to <i>understand it all</i> -- I certainly know it is for me. The core of faith, though, is just that -- faith. A choice, a decision to believe even though all is not understood. That's the 'foolishness' Christ calls us to, I believe.

<a href="http://humblepen7.livejournal.com">humblepen7</a> <b> asks, What do women REALLY want? And where can I buy it in bulk?</b>
Oooh, what a dangerous question you ask, my friend. We all speculate about these matters in private, but bringing those idle thoughts into the light of day is rarely a wise decision. If we come up with complex answers, the women around us are wont to cry, "What's so difficult? It's no big secret! We just want love and respect!" If we offer a simple answer, though, the tables turn. "That's it? You think you have it all figured out? Hah! We're more complex than that!" It's a paradox. I've come to the conclusion that the best approach is to focus on what <i>human beings need</i> rather than <i>what women want</i>... Kindness, a listening ear, honesty and sincerity, encouragement, and occasionally unpleasant truths if they are necessary. It's about caring and genuinely desiring the best for someone, I think. Flowers help, too. I suggest lilies ofr a first bouquet.

<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a> <b> asks, Do you realise that it's stuff like this that leaves you open to strange girls asking you to have sex with them?</b>
Unfortunately, those kinds of things only occur to me after the fact. I was expecting lots of stuff about C# and the book of Ecclesiastes, with maybe some 'What's up with the rubber duckie?' questions mixed in.

<a href="http://pouk23.livejournal.com">pouk23</a> <b> asks, Dost thou cyber, m'lady?</b>
Me love you, baby. Me love you long time.

<a href="http://broohaha.livejournal.com">broohaha</a> <b> asks, Would you eat mayonaise from a tube?</b>
Is it <i>friendly</i> mayonaise? If so, I would be willing to eat it in combination with, perhaps, a <i>sandwich</i> of some kind. Egg salad would not, in fact, be out of the question.

<a href="http://jessypie.livejournal.com">jessypie</a> <b> asks, How is a raven like a writing-desk?</b>
Because it can produce a few notes, tho they are very  flat; and it is never put with the wrong end in front.

<a href="http://lapintada.livejournal.com">lapintada</a> <b> asks, How much wood would a wood chuck chuck, if a wood chuck could chuck wood?</b>
Contrary to popular opinion, most wood chucks are passionate conservationists. They prefer a good sleeping bag to a wood-frame house.

<a href="http://sarianastar.livejournal.com">sarianastar</a> <b> asks, What is your greatest wish?</b>
To love and be loved. And to dance on the grave of Oracle 9i for Windows.

<a href="http://joanofarrgh.livejournal.com">joanofarrgh</a> <b> asks, Is that all there is?</b>
Yes. As polls go, it's a little sparse. I make no apologies! It's Zen minimalism! It's <i>art,</i> I tell you!

<a href="http://smoldering.livejournal.com">smoldering</a> <b> asks, If the smurfs and the keebler elves had a war, who do you think would win?</b>
Clearly, the keebler elves. Although the Smurfs are wilderness creatures obviously well versed in the arts of guerilla warfare, the Keebler Elves seem to be masters of industry. Though the Smurfs can run, they can't hide: gigantic mecha-robots made of sweet milk chocolate and graham crackers are sure to give chase.

<a href="http://hawking.livejournal.com">hawking</a> <b> asks, Why are you so absolutely enraptured with the pure essence of little rubber ducky?</b> 
Haha! There's that duckie question I was waiting for. I knew I could count on you. The duckie question is a complex one. It dates back to the mid '90s, when <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> and others formed db:SonicA, a spiffy electro-industrial group. The vocalist gave me a rubber duck. I named him 'Squeaky,' after the Enforcer of the same name in Neil Stephenson's seminal cyberpunk novel Snow Crash. Squeaky went everywhere with us. Eventually, he got stunt doubles. Then more ducks arrived. Then people gave them as gifts. Sometimes, I catch them going at it under the table when they think no one's looking. Now they're everywhere.

<a href="http://broohaha.livejournal.com">broohaha</a> <b> asks, Do they bottle the pure essence of little rubber ducky?</b>
Yes. It can be purchased in vials, jugs, and drums.

<a href="http://therachel.livejournal.com">therachel</a> <b> asks, Wouldn't it be funny if Tammy Faye Baker was a Bagle Maker on her own television show and frequently Kevin Bacon appeared as a special guest in which he would teach Tammy Faye Baker Bagle Maker to Bake Bodacious Bacon Burgers?</b>
Verily, that would kick ass.
