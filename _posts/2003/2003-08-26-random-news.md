<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44762-2003Aug25.html" target="_blank">Protests lead to ZippoTricks shutdown</a>...
Kind of sad. A guy started <a href="http://www.zippotricks.com" target="_blank">a cool site</a> about doing tricks with Zippo lighters, way back in '96, and it was eventually purchased by Zippo. Now they've shut it down because of complaints that it glamorizes <i>playing with fire.</i> Please. Think of the children. Next? Outlaw coin tricks -- they promote greed.

This story, though... this one's gut-wrenching. A father discovers that his two children were both born with an exceedingly rare genetic disorder that will almost certainly leave them dead before they reach the age of ten. His response? Mortgage the house. Start a biotech research company on a shoestring budget. Make progress, then secure investors until you can sell to a larger firm with more resources to fund the development. His fight continues -- he's driving an entire business because he wants to save his kids. Awesome. Painful. An amazing read.
