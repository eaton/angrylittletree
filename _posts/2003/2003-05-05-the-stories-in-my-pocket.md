Those who know me probably know that the last week or so has been a very difficult one as I've struggled and dealt with a number of issues in my life and relationships. Studying one's own heart and determining one's course for the future is never an easy task, and for those of you who've been with me through it, all I can say is thank you. Words can't capture the debt of love and friendship that I owe all of you.

For all of that, though, I am struck by wonder as I drive to work this morning, crawling through the traffic on 294. There is so much beauty in the world, so much to love and soak up.

Patterns of traffic on city streets. The wind through my window. Hundred-fingered trees stretching for the clouds left from last night's thunderstorms. Tangled chain link fences at the side of the road, dents and kinks telling stories of kids who climbed and jumped them years ago. Towers and power lines slicing clear blue sky into perfect tangram patterns.

As I pull off of I90, passing the Nemeth Glass building, I'm on Lawrence Avenue. An old woman, wrapped in her shawl, pedals her way through traffic on an old 2-speed bicycle. Fruit is piled high in its wicker basket and I can imagine her smile when she takes the first bite.

And now, as I sit down at my desk to finish the last of a job that has kept my bills paid and food in my stomach for eight months, as I prepare to start another adventure with new co-workers and an old friend... I smile.

<i>Thank you, Father, for your world which is my church.
For your body, which is my life.
For your love, which is my joy.</i>

Nothing is any easier today. Things that hurt before still do. Fears that hid in the dark corners of my psyche for years are still holed up, snapping and scratching when I get too close. But the sun's out, in more ways than one.
