<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a> suggests an 'Ask Predicate' column. I fear.

<a href="http://shig23.livejournal.com">shig23</a> <b>asks, "Where's that programmable self-replicating molecular nanoassembler I ordered back in 1988?"</b>
Unfortunately, the nanotech market has only recently matured to the point where orders as large as yours can be fulfilled in a timely manner. <a href="http://www.cnanotech.com/pages/store/6-0_online_store.html" target="_blank">Our supplier</a> is working to satisfy a basic parts shortage, and <a href="http://www.zyvex.com/" target="_blank">one of our primary equipment vendors</a> has been troubleshooting difficult to reproduce errors with the <a href="http://www.zyvex.com/Products/tools.html" target="_blank">nanomanipulators</a>. We're confident, however, that the self replicating nanoassemblers will be ready in time for your scheduled October, 2007 showdown with Dr. Xavier and his associates.

<a href="http://stimps.livejournal.com">stimps</a> <b>asks, "What are your favourite noodles, and what do you like to do with them?"</b>
I prefer the thick wide noodles. I'm not sure what they're called, but with cheesy sauce they're most excellent. I am pasta-illiterate, but I know good noodles when I taste them.

<a href="http://danaamor.livejournal.com">danaamor</a> <b>asks, "How much steak can one man consume on a weekly basis?"</b>
More than you would think. I, for example, have had no less then <i>four</i> steaks this week. With so many vegans and vegetarians in our world today, meatitarians must pick up the slack to prevent overpopulation in the cow world. It's our sacrifice for the greater good.

<a href="http://porchrock.livejournal.com">porchrock</a> <b>asks, "Why do fools fall in love?"</b>
Why does the sun rise? Why do birds sing? Why does Network Solutions forget to process your payment for domain name renewal, then hold it hostage for two months after it expires, demanding $300 to restore it from 'post expiration status,' then sell it to a domain poacher? These aren't things we should question. We must simply accept them, and live our lives accordingly.

<a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a> <b>asks, "If I check my balance 12 times, even when I know it hasn't changed, is that obsessive compulsive?"</b>
Possibly. If you check your balance 13 times, 17 times, 19 times, 23 times, 29 times, 37 times, or any other prime number, you may well be obsessive compulsive. If you find yourself checking 29 times specifically <i>because it's a prime number,</i> then yes. You are obsessive compulsive. Welcome to the club! May I suggest our excellent powers-of-two sampler pack?

<a href="http://fruitbat5150.livejournal.com">fruitbat5150</a> <b>asks, "If I help you get a date, will that help the Cubs win the series?"</b>
I don't know if I like the way this series of questions is going... Will this result in my being set up with a series of increasingly scary people while you place bets on the 2004 World Series? If so, well... I guess I'm willing to take one for the team.

<a href="http://hippocampus_gen.livejournal.com">hippocampus_gen</a> <b>asks, "why not?"</b>
Once again, the gnomes are key. It's sort of a paradox...

<a href="http://wlonkly.livejournal.com">wlonkly</a> <b>asks, "Who is your inspiration?"</b>
In the broad big-picture sort of way, God. I believe that creating beauty is a worthwhile pursuit. First, because it brings joy and pleasure to those who see it. Second, because we are created with gifts of expression and perspective that would be a tragedy to waste. In the short term, of course, it's a Girl. Isn't it always?

<a href="http://slog.livejournal.com">slog</a> <b>asks, "How are you doing?"</b>
Thanks for asking! I'm doing alright these days. Relationship stuff is always a little frustrating, but that's just part of life. Work is going alright, and I'm seriously looking into replacing my old digital camera. You know, the one that was stolen when my car was wrecked? Yep. That one. I'm pretty tired and drained lately, juggling a lot of work and extracurricular activities, and some confusing introspection, but it'll be good. Further bulletins as events warrant!

<a href="http://treechunk.livejournal.com">treechunk</a> <b>asks, "What does that stupid color 9 smell like anyway?"</b>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0262531526/qid=1049501360/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_2/104-8391996-6338368?v=glance&s=books&n=507846" target="_blank">The color nine, obviously, smells like circles.</a>

<a href="http://kateordie.livejournal.com">kateordie</a> <b>asks, "Why did my dandelions wilt? I put them in water and everything!"</b>
Dandelions, once picked, will only stay pretty and flowery for a few hours. Unlike roses, tulips, and other flowers, dandelons are <i>weeds.</i> This means their energy is 100% survival focused. Pretty blossoms? Pff! They're all about getting it on. Bloom, disperse, and repeat. Keeping this in mind, you might try playing some Barry White music in the background.

<a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> <b>asks, "Is Jack Chick the antichrist?"</b>
Well, let's do the math. The ASCII value of 'Jack' is 377, and I'm pretty sure that 'Chick' is even more. That rules out a direct ASCII translation to '666,' but we've never actually <i>seen</i> Mr. Chick, have we? Perhaps he's the prophet of the beast? It's worth investigating.

<a href="http://fur.livejournal.com">fur</a> <b>asks, "Wanna go out sometime? :)"</b>
Man... Suddenly <i>everybody's</i> a Cubs fan!

 <a href="http://weds.livejournal.com">weds</a> <b>asks, "So, I forget. Which one of us kissed the other on the nose and caused you to freak out?"</b>
Woooah there! I kissed <i>you</i> on the nose, and I have no recollection of freaking out! I just remember you calling me a geek, and being overcome with happiness at the wonderful compliment. There was, however, much controversy over the next couple of hours if I remember correctly. Large Usenet picnics are hotbeds of rumor.
