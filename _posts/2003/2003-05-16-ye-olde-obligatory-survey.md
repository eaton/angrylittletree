Stolen from <a href="http://fur.livejournal.com">fur</a>... a list of lasts.

<b>last cigarette:</b> Does the time I used a burning cigarette and twelve inches of twine as a makeshift fuse count?
<b>last car ride:</b> Three hours ago, heading in to work.
<b>last kiss:</b> December 2000.<!--break-->
<b>last good cry:</b> No comment.
<b>last library book checked out:</b> <i>Mirrorshades,</i> edited by Bruce Sterling. When this baby goes back in print, I'm <i>so</i> there.
<b>last movie seen:</b> The Matrix: Reloaded. C'mon, what did you <i>expect?</i>
<b>last book read:</b> <i>Strunk and White's Elements of Style.</i> The new edition's out, people! Run, don't walk!
<b>last cuss word uttered:</b> Fuckwit!
<b>last beverage drank:</b> Coffee, creamed beyond recognition.
<b>last food consumed:</b> Seasoned flatbread with soft feta cheese. Mmmmmm. Nummy!
<b>last crush:</b> Orange.
<b>last phone call:</b> <a href="http://texasjeff.livejournal.com">texasjeff</a> -- apparently, he was on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, and needed to call a friend...
<b>last tv show watched:</b> Er... wow. I don't watch much TV. Probably Mad About You on DVD.
<b>last time showered:</b> This morning. I'm a tidy boy.
<b>last cd played:</b> Custom comp. The terribly dangerous lock-and-key comp. <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> knows the score.
<b>last item bought:</b> A new optical mouse.
<b>last downloaded:</b> Winamp 2.91. None of this "three point oh" business for me, thankyouverymuch.
<b>last annoyance:</b> Forgetting my Billie Holiday CD for the drive to work.
<b>last disappointment:</b> No marshmallow clouds and lollypop trees outside this morning.
<b>last soda drank:</b> Sprite, because I <i>do</i> in fact like the Sprite in you.
<b>last key used:</b> Er... Like... on my keyboard, or my keyring? Probably my car key if the latter. That was really confusing for a minute, there.
<b>last words spoken:</b> "Ooooohh, it's not disabling that control group at all..."
<b>last sleep:</b> Last night. A remarkable 7 hours, uninterrupted.
<b>last im:</b> "I'll get you, my pretty, and your little rook, too..."
<b>last sexual fantasy:</b> Does the Quizno's Dream count?
<b>last weird encounter:</b> Occasionally, I have <i>normal</i> encounters.
<b>last ice cream eaten:</b> Monday. Tate's Ice Cream shop. 
<b>last time wanting to die:</b> Installing Oracle 9i on a laptop.
<b>last time in love:</b> Friday. (Cue The Cure...)
<b>last time hugged:</b> Thursday afternoon.
<b>last time scolded:</b> Wednesday, by <a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a>.
<b>last time resentful:</b> Probably the last time I was given advice by a parent. It's good advice usually, but you know how hard it is to take it from the people who raised you, y'know? Being conscious of the effect helps minimize it, though.
<b>last chair sat in:</b> The... one I'm in right now? Swivelly? With arm rests?
<b>last lipstick used:</b> [dramatic pause] I have the terrible feeling I've stumbled into a quiz not meant for My Kind.
<b>last underwear worn:</b> Krispy Kreme boxers.
<b>last bra worn:</b> [dramatic pause] Yes, I do believe my suspicion is correct.
<b>last shirt worn:</b> Black Starflyer 59 t-shirt. Fashion Focus, baby.
<b>last time dancing:</b> Willow Creek Community Church's parking lot.
<b>last webpage visited:</b> http://www.winamp.com
