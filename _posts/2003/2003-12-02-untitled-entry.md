Random Amazon surfing led me to this little gem: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000AOX0N/002-3825322-1486418?v=glance&s=dvd" target="_blank">The Land Before Time X - The Great Longneck Migration</a>. Stop for a moment, and think. Remember when <i>The Land Before Time</i> came out in theaters? That was a long, long time ago. Apparently, while the rest of us havebeen busy learning about <i>Nemo</i> and <i>The Matrix</i> and picking up job skills, this movie has spawned a series of sequels four blocks long.

<i>The Land Before Time <b>Ten?!</b></i> Did Robert Jordan take over a new franchise or something?
