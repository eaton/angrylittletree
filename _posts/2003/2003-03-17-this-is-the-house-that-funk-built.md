So I've been thinking of posting some of the notes from the teaching sessions at Fusion. I've also been thinking about posting a few more clips of fiction and poetry. Perhaps even writing some new stuff... Zounds!

I don't like the idea of spamming <i>everyone</i> with them, though, so I'm setting up a restricted friends group for those who're interested in reading that stuff. Drop me a line if you want to see those posts, and I'll add you.
