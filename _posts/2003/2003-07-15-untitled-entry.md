Impromptu Karaoke moment.

Right Said Fred: I'm Too Sexy.

I love my friends. I really, really do.

Laughter, goofiness, moments of pure unadulterated genius... It's times like this that I'm just very, very pleased to be alive and know the people I do. Gotta write these moments down -- it's easy to forget them when bad times come, and that would be a shame.

<i>I'm... Too sexy for my car... too sexy by far...</i>

You <b>go,</b> Petey.
