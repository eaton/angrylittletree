crazy weekend. i learned things about nyquil, asprin, and paxil that no one should

concluded 30 minutes ago with a 2 hour conversation with <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a>. summarized my introspection-litmus-tests for relationship related questions.

<ol>
<li><b>Is this attraction exclusive?</b> If I'm trying to decide between two love interests, I am most likely not emotionally ready to be with either of them.</li>
<li><b>Am I willing to give her up?</b> If I truly believed that something was best for her, but it would mean never being able to see her again, would I be willing to do it? (i.e., if she were to get mad and cut off contact, would I still attempt to point out a dangerous and unhealthy pattern in her life? Would I be willing to leave the relationship if I saw that contact with me was detrimental to her, emotionally/spiritually/etc?)</li>
<li><b>Would I be happy if someone else loved her?</b> If someone else were to love her in all of the full and true ways that I aspire to, and she were to choose them over me... would I be pleased that she was loved? (This isn't about being oblivious to pain and disapointment. Just... on some level, would I be able to have joy that she was truly loved by her mate?)</li>
</ol>

They're not perrfect, but they're sobering.
