Three and a half hours, and not a moment of film to cut.

<i>Return of the King</i> was amazing. Truly amazing. Saw it with a bunch of the Fusion crew -- <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> arrived at the theater almost three hours early to stake out our place in line, and ended up first. When we all got there, we spent fifteen minutes debating our ideal location and entrance strategy. Two left, two right, the other six of us blocking to slow down other movie-goers until we'd staked out our seats...

After seeing it, I can say I'd have waited twice as long. It's just that good. I'm sure as time passes people will have things to nitpick, but... wow. Very, very tight. It's epic in all the right ways, and the muddling qualities that threatened The Two Towers aren't there. The pacing is good and you can feel things building towards the inevitable world-altering climax.

Man. What an awesome night.
