Domesticity sneaks up on you when you least expect it.

I went home for lunch today and, on a whim, baked cookies. The dough was straight from the freezer, courtesy Pilsbury, so I can't claim that I had much to do with the quality or lack thereof. But there's something gratifying about carrying a plate of still-steaming macadamia nut cookies into the office when you return.
