So I plod home from work, and what should I find waiting for me? A package from Amazon.

I squint, curious, as I have not recently ordered anything from Amazon. What could this be?

I open it.

It's a Cure video. I blink.

Under the Cure video is a travel guide to Havana.

It's a birthday gift from <a href="http://sprockette.livejournal.com">sprockette</a>, who clearly understands what my psyche uses for fuel. You rock, sprockette. Thank you!
