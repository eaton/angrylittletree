Why, you ask?

Because the new version of <a href="http://semagic.livejournal.com">semagic</a> auto-detects the current music playing in <a href="http://www.winamp.com">WinAmp 3</a>. Yay. I have my auto-detect back again.

In other news, I got <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo IM</a> support working in <a href="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">Trillian</a>. For a few months I've thought it was broken. Turns out, I'd just entered my user name incorrectly. Har. Har har.
