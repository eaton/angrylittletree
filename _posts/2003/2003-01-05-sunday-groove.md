so the <a href="http://www.sprintpcs.com" target="_blank">phone</a> rings at noon and I wake up and groan -- it's <a href="http://www.predicate.net/users/analog" target="_blank">jason,</a> and he's just finished stocking the <a href="http://mapsonus.switchboard.com/bin/maps-maponly/usr=~3e1926a5.b58cb.41fc.5/c=2/isredir=1/" target="_blank">park and roosevelt jewel/osco</a> with <a href="http://www.fritolay.com/" target="_blank">frito lay</a> <a href="http://www.fritolay.com/consumer/funfoods/history/tostitos.html" target="_blank">products</a>. we hook up and head out to <a href="http://www.bostonmarket.com/" target="_blank">boston market</a> for munchies, <a href="http://decapolis.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=6;t=001159" target="_blank">discuss the infallability of scripture</a>, and select 'monk porn' as a possible contender for the 'most incredibly wrong idea ever' award.

arrive back at the rancho del eaton, chill, go over a couple of jason's newest songs. amazing, luscious stuff that makes me start writing down shots and angles for a video before the chorus has even kicked in. eventually we settle in and start learning the ins and outs of <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/" target="_blank">mechwarrior: dark age</a>. we make a first attempt at a battle, and later i challenge my dad to a game on the living room floor.

my <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?unitid=2595" target="_blank">koshi mech</a> and <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?unitid=2562" target="_blank">marksman tank</a> - easily the heaviest two-fisted punch on the battlefield this evening - are formidable. a single armored infantry unit, sporting jump jets and energy weapons, provides cover. my initial flanking maneuver catches his force -- half a dozen infantry units and a heavy tank -- off guard and splits the main body of his force. i use the cover of a large office complex to good effect and gain high ground with my koshi early. eventually, though, he flanks me and gains even higher ground with a jumpjetting gnome battalion. my mech takes enough damage to drio it back in the striking range of his other infantry units, and it's all downhill from there...

hmmmm. time to strategize.
