So I went to traffic court today. Back in January I was involved in a nasty little wreck with a CTA bus that left my Toyota totaled. I was carless, stranded, and generally up doody creek without a paddle until a great used Honda Civic dropped into my lap. The other aftermath, however, was a personal injury claim by the bus driver. I had to appear in traffic court in downtown Chicago today, something I've never done before thanks to my pretty-clean driving record. Stress. Much stress. And then some stress, on top of it! Terrible images of L.A. Law sprang to mind as I sat, pensive, waiting for my case number to be called. Would some late-night-TV-ad personal injury lawyer be circling vulture-like, waiting to cash in on this Rich Suburb Kid Who Hit A Bus? Surely he'd be disappointed to realize I'm about as rich as tofu. Would I be forced to defend myself? Justify my attempt to stop on snow-slick pavement?

40 minutes ticked by under flourescent lights with dozens of cases heard rapid-fire.

I watched as Abdul pled guilty to driving without a license, Stanley insisted he hadn't made an illegal left turn, and Wendy explained that she was uninsured due to a clerical error. More time crawled by. Finally, they called my name.

"Jeff Eaton?" I stepped up to the bench and nodded. The judge looked up over his glasses, turned to the prosecutor. "There a CTA rep here today?"

"Nope. Move to dismiss."

"Case dismissed. Drive safely."

He handed me my license in a plastic envelope. I blinked.

So I've been contemplating putting together the codebase for a Quiz hosting site. Does anyone have any ideas for cool features? I'm looking forward to a day when I might set up a pay-for-added-features system on it. You know, donate $10 via paypal and get your account upgraded to support custom interface templates, or more types of quizzes, etc. No, I'm not trying to set that up <b>now.</b> I'm just asking what kind of features would be nifty in a quiz site.
