Yay.

A while back, I took a batch of low-light photos with my new camera -- traffic shots on I90, near the train tracks. I was really pleased with the way they turned out, but the batch of photos was lost when I burnt it onto a bad CDR and didn't realize it until after I'd erased the originals. I just realized that I had uploaded the single best image from the batch -- in full 20x30 inch resolution -- to my Shutterfly account. Although I don't have it in digital form anymore, I can still order large format prints of it. Yay! Happy!
