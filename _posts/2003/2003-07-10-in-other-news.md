I spent a good chunk of last night working on some <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com" target="_blank">Havana Moderne</a> related stuff. Although it now looks as if there's <i>less</i> progress on the site, I'm transitioning to a more robust database, a better underlying database schema, and so on. I'm doing better at learning how to integrate other peoples' code and ideas, rather than reinventing the wheel every time I approach a new project.
