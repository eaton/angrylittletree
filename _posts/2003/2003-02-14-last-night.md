...Someone asked me what I look for in potential relationship. (This followed the usual 'So why are you single on Valentines Day?' 'I'm a three-armed mutant tree sloth.' 'Other than that.' conversation...)

Presented without further ado is The List which I keep folded up in my wallet for reference.

<ol>
<li>Must love God and desire to know Him, grow closer to Him, and please Him.
<li>Must be compassionate, empathetic, and patient with those who irritate, disagree with, or attack her.
<li>Must love beauty and recognize it in at least some form -- art, literature, music, poetry, calligraphy, etc.
<li>Must love learning.
<li>Must be a sensual (though not necessarily 'sexy') person.
<li>Must believe passionately, and love sharing those beliefs.
<li>Must be open-minded, willing to listen to others honestly and sincerely without sacrificing belief or integrity.
<li>Must laugh.
<li>Must not be quick to take offense.
<li>Must bowl a 160 average or higher.
</ol>

And now, I wander off to play MechWarrior: Dark Age tournaments on Valentines Day. I point out, to the observant reader, that THIS fact may well also be one of the reasons... ;)
