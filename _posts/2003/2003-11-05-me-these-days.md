<b><a href="http://rubypython.livejournal.com">rubypython</a> -- Will we play MechWarrior when I'm there in December, or will we be forced to have a vicious fight to the death with some bad ass katana and sai?</b>
Yes. Yes, we will. I'm not opposed to the katana fight -- you'll remember, though, that as the mysterious loner who's the second in command of your international mafia, you never know what life-altering secrets I'll reveal in hte moment of my tragic demise. Perhaps... I'm your SON!

<b><a href="http://heatherding.livejournal.com">heatherding</a> -- is there any question that you haven't been asked that you would LOVE to answer?</b>
"So, Jeff. Tell me about <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/teaser.html">Havana Moderne</a>."

<b><a href="http://fruitbat5150.livejournal.com">fruitbat5150</a> -- Do humans have free will? Do any non-human animals have free will?</b> 
I suppose it depends on how one defines 'free will.' I believe we <i>do</i> have free will, and I define it as the ability to make fundamental decisions about one's own moral state without coercion. There are always external influences, factors that shape our decisions. But at the core, I believe we have the ability to choose Good or Evil in our responses to each of those influences. Societal and cultural influences shape what we see as good and evil, but we still have the choice IMO. Now... the trick is that this also hinges on the ability to understand Good and Evil. I'm not sure that other animals have that, though I know friends who do believe it. I'd guess that 'free will' really depends on that.

<b><a href="http://joanofarrgh.livejournal.com">joanofarrgh</a> -- your 15 minutes of fame: how would you get them, and what would you do with them?</b>
Wow, that's tough. Honestly I've always dreamed of a sort of behind hte scenes catalyst role... You know, the person that gets stuff done and acts as a catalyst even though there might not be recognition? I <i>really</i> like the idea of changing the world in a positive way and sometimes fame seems to be a detriment to that. Although it affords a platform, it also marginalizes one's voice as "Celebrity Opinion."

Hmmm. Hmm hmm. I guess I'd envision my 15 minutes of fame, then, coming from some kind of 'behind the scenes' special filmed in the 2030's, detailing the life and times of the people who helped completely reshape the face of Christian culture in north america. ;) That'd be pretty cool. Welcome to my ego. What would I do with it? More of the same...
