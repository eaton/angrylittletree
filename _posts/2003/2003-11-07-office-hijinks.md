I'm typing away, fixing a table-locking bug in my export code, when I hear footsteps behind me. Usually this means that Todd is walking a new bug report over, so I wait a few moments before turning around. When I do, though, there's a kid -- a shy little girl of eight or nine half-peeking around the side of my door, nibbling thoughtfully on one of her knuckles. She's wearing overalls and striped socks and sneakers, and she smiles behind frizzy bangs.

"Hi."

I blink, and say, "Hey."

I smile, and then she turns and walks down the hall, out of view.

Inexplicable.
