Why the hell do people feel the need to set me up?

Am I wearing some sort of "Hello, please tell strangers I need a date" sign that I was not aware of?

Let me hang out with my friends and write my middleware and read my books and play my frisbee and plan my global conquest. It's a good life, and I'm pretty cool with it, you know?

I don't want life to imitate this particular art, capiche?

[long pause]

Ech.

That sounded a lot more bitter than I intended it to -- more of a situational frustration than anything else. I have a particular friend who's been married for a year or so, and tends to be very smug in her pronouncements of what I need in order to be happy.

I mean, yes. I understand that there are certainly times when I'm lonely, and desire affection and companionship and someone to share my life with. Denying that would be silly!

But I take it seriously, and that means I don't just troll around for 'elligible women' to date. I don't like the idea that someone sees the current place I'm at in life -- single, cultivating lots of close friendships, living life and trying to grow -- as some kind of shallow, stunted excuse for living.

I'm not anti-relationship by any means. I'm not bitter that I'm not *in* a relationship. I'm not even grumpy about people who are, or something. It's the fact that other people try to set me up <b>not</b> based on the idea that they know someone similarly quirky/passionate/etc. and think we'd get along well, but rather on the idea that I am an incomplete, hollow person and must be shopped around to various potential mates before I can hope to be content.

I've yet to see a married couple that's content because they have each other. Some are miserable. Others are content. The ones who are content are the ones who are emotionally mature, healthy people <b>as individuals</b>... When they come together, they meet as equals who want to share a relationship, share a life together, and even -- dare I suggest! -- share a vision for something bigger than either themselves or 'the marriage' itself.

There. That's my rant.
