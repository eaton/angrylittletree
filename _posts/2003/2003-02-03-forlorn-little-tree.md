So I've been depressed lately.

Despite what one might expect, it has nothing to do with things like the car being wrecked, the camera being stolen, or driving two to three hours a day to work. It doesn't have anything to do with job uncertainty or frustration with personal side projects. More accurately, those things are exacerbated by the sense of general funk that I've been experiencing.

Over the last couple years I've been slowly starting to wonder if I might be exhibiting the signs of clinical depression. Or more accurately, putting less energy into denying it. I react in strange ways to the idea of it. Part of me recoils from the possibility that I might be 'depressed.' As if it's a weak, pitiable thing. The opposite of what I desperately hope everyone sees in me. Ironically, I don't think that about other people who suffer from depression. My friends, loved ones, and so on aren't <i>weak</i> when they are emotionally tapped out. They're human. I hold myself to different standards, of course.

The other half of my psyche grins, toothy and sly, like a dog about to fight. Clinical depression? <i>Hell yeah,</i> I say to myself. <i>I'm depressed as all get-out and I make it.</i> I smile. I can find joy in the depths of emotional despair. <i>Bite me, clinical depression. You don't scare me.</i> It's that <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com" target="_blank">Calebesque</a> part of me, the part that sees every painful experience as a chance to prove myself to myself, that keeps me going many times. It's a challenge. A war. A fight to keep from crumbling and being weak.

I know, I know, I say to myself as I write this. It's not weak to admit that you're empty. But it feels that way. It's not a sin to be weak, even. But it feels as if I've exposed myself, left myself open to barbs and jabs and pricks and pity from those around me.

Relationships have been a tough subject to deal with lately, too. I have no right to complain, of course. I've chosen my own circumstances and I'm forced to place the blame for any discontent directly at my own feet. But I'm not discontented, really. I'm pleased with the choices I've made and I think any others would have been mistakes. I'm single and I'm glad. Not because I don't want to be with anyone, but because I know my reasons for being with others in the past would have been wrong. Not just wrong, but incapable of supporting a real relationship. Ill-fated.

So I don't admit that I'm lonely. Because when you're lonely, people either try to fix it -- try to fit themselves into a hole in your life that can only be filled by your own healthiness, your own growth as a person... Or they back away. Outside of clinging-range, lest you flail and splash emotionally and drag them down with you. I don't want either of those things. I just want to be me, and I want to admit what I am, who I am, and how I am.

Eh. Rambling.

Three cheers for TMI.
