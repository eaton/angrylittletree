I can't count the number of times I've popped open LiveJournal and started work on an entry to sum up the things going on in my life, in my head, and around me. I can't count the number of times the attempt has concluded with a sigh, a headache, and a resigned slump off to bed instead of a finished post.

I feel tapped out emotionally these days, and every time I feel like I'm getting a leg up on it something else comes along. If it's not interpersonal problems with close friends it's job stress or (!!!) collisions with CTA busses. I mean, I have a great life all things considered. I have work, a roof over my head, I'm not in debt, I have a great circle of friends, and all that good stuff.

Eh. Nothing too earth-shattering. Just a note that I'm still here, still alive, still plugging away. Just a bit more silent than usual.
