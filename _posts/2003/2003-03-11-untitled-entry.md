It's difficult to accept genuine praise, especially when it comes from someone who matters to me. It seems backwards, doesn't it? Some things I'm confident about -- certain types of writing, certain ideas I've shaped and polished for years, and know I can present clearly and articulately. The scary stuff, though -- attempts at <i>art</i>, or things that bare the soul -- those leave me uncertain. Self-critical. Unwilling to accept others' heartfelt compliments, for fear that I'm only being humored.

Not a mopey or self-pitying entry, really -- just a thoughtful ponder about why praise leaves me so off balance.
