<i>I Miss my head, miss my heart, miss my lungs 
Be what you want to be 
Watch what you want to see 
Killed for fun </i>
<!--break--><i>Down a hole, up a rope 
Down some pills, up some hope 
This karma machine only takes quarters 
New age soldier, new age soldier 

Everybody's all right 
Everything is automatic 
And everybody's all right 
Everything is skin deep 

Everybody's all right 
And everything is automatic 
Everybody's all right 
And everything is skin deep, me 

Say hey, say hey, say how ya doing 
Say hey, say hey, say how ya doing 

I miss my lazy boy 
I miss my TV 
I miss myself 
Do you miss your lazy boy 
Do you miss your TV 
Do you miss yourself 

Everybody's all right 
Everything is automatic 
Everybody's all right 
Everything is skin deep 

Everybody's all right 
Everything is automatic 
Everybody's' all right 
Everything is skin deep, me 

It's always what I wanted 
It's always what I wanted 
It's always what I 

Killed for fun 
It's fucking funny don't you think 
One day you'll decompose 
And you wake up and those 
Those birds are singing 
Those birds are singing 

It's always what I wanted 
It's always what I wanted 
It's always what I 
It's always what I 

Everything is skin deep</i>

Couldn't have picked a better doppleganger if I tried.
