Mmmm. So, stirfry went over great with the gang Monday night -- cooking for six is a little bit of a stretch for me but it turned out alright. It's strange how much I enjoy cooking a meal like that, especially one that calls for improvisation. Talking with <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> afterwards, we came to the conclusion that it's the tactile, visceral immediacy of cooking that's so appealing to me. I tend to do a lot of introspection, processing, pondering, and analysis. There are very few aspects of my life that I'm not constantly chewing on and turning over and peering at from different angles, looking for new insights. When you've got a bunch of onions and garlic sizzling and carmelizing in the bottom of the wok and you're stirring the beef around and tossing in bell peppers and dousing it with soy sauce, though, there's no time for analysis. It's an act that exists completely in the <i>now</i>. And I love it.
