Had scrumptious sushi after a day of semi-frustration at work. Lots of little things breaking, lots of little hassles. No show-stoppers, just the whack-a-mole game of hunting down the last bugs in a large complex piece of software.

Grilled eel is definitely a good thing.

Random retail therapy of the moment includes my new Spider Jerusalem Action Figure, and a copy of the <i>Decologue.</i> I love living in a world where a comic book journalist with a three-eyed pet cat and a heroin habit gets his own action figure.
