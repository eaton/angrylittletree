Hah.

Who would've suspected text hidden behind images in an LJ-Cut? This'll separate the wheat from the chaff. It's 1:15 in the morning. Daylight savings time has kicked in -- or bowed out? I can never remember which way it goes -- and I had a pretty packed weekend. Parties, meetings, steak, all the usual good stuff. Got a haircut so I don't look like a fuggin' mushroom anymore.

So I capped off the weekend watching How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days with <a href="http://jennafish7.livejournal.com">jennafish7</a>, <a href="http://rdecker.livejournal.com">rdecker</a>, and eric. Reminded me, for some reason, of the time that <a href="http://naterlie.livejournal.com">naterlie</a> and I got into an argument about a Percy Sledge song.

<blockquote><i>
When a man loves a woman 
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else 
He'd trade the world 
For a good thing he's found 
If she is bad, he can't see it 
She can do no wrong 
Turn his back on his best friend 
If he puts her down 

When a man loves a woman 
I give you everything I've got (yeah) 
Trying to hold on 
To your precious love 
Baby please don't treat me bad 

When a man loves a woman 
Deep down in his soul 
She can bring him such misery 
If she is playing him for a fool 
He's the last one to know 
Loving eyes can never see 
</i></blockquote>

Naterlie thought it was about the trust that's there in true love. I thought it was about how fucked up relationships can be -- love's a game, and the house always wins, all that good stuff. Admittedly, she was probably right about the author's intent. But I'd be a terrible little deconstructionist if I couldn't bend the text to suit my interperetation.

Anyways, tonight I'm sitting there. The movie's a by the numbers sort of thing with a couple funny spots and a sadistic twist. Because I'm not feeling particularly creative, I'll quote <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/ebert1/wkp-news-guy07f.html" target="_blank">Roger Ebert's insightful analysis</a>:

<blockquote><i>
I am just about ready to write off movies in which people make bets about whether they will, or will not, fall in love. The premise is fundamentally unsound, since it subverts every love scene with a lying subtext. Characters are nice when they want to be mean, or mean when they want to be nice. The easiest thing at the movies is to sympathize with two people who are falling in love. The hardest thing is to sympathize with two people who are denying their feelings, misleading each other, and causing pain to a trusting heart. This is comedy only by dictionary definition. In life, it is unpleasant.
</blockquote></i>

So I'm sitting there as this film plays out like a tribute to deception, a warning to those who would ever consider trusting. And I'm smirking to myself realizing that I've spent the last how many months obsessing over Relationship and Girl and the whole fucking deal with that, and subsequently realizing the film would be a lot funnier if the grim and twisted scenes weren't like journal entries from my last relationship... And it hits me. I'm really, really glad I'm single. Fundamentally glad. Sure, I'm lonely. Sure, I want to connect. Sure, I want to find someone and build a life with them and love them. But hey, hell if I know how <i>that</i> would happen. I think about all the stuff that people talk about going along with "love"... The trust, the willingness to be hurt by the beloved, being willing to seem like a fool... And I'm just not willing to. It's as simple as that.

The pain, the self-loathing, the knife-bite of each memory once its rose-colored story is repainted by subsequent events... The memories of the things you did, the hurts you set aside and forgave and worked through and forgot because <i>you loved her.</i> The realization that all they ever accomplished was flicking the 'abuse me' switch on even brighter.

It's just not worth it. The house always wins -- you don't hit the jackpot by playing a lot, you do it by knowing when to walk away.
