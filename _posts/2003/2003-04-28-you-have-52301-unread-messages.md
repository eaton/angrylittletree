A while back, I set up a nice error notification system for the site that we're working on finishing. When an unhandled error occurs deep within the bowels of the site, I get an email explaining the specifics of the error and what the user was doing at the time. It works nicely, and makes troubleshooting the obscure stuff a lot easier.

Unfortunately, when something <i>really</i> goes wrong, especially with the wicked, wicked SOAP server we're using, I tend to get lots of these emails.

Really, really lots.

Like, fifty thousand pieces of email lots.

I don't think I'm going to be able to read all those messages.
