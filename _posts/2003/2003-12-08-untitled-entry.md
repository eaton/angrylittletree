Just posted - <a href="http://www.guerrillanews.com/human_rights/doc3566.html" target="_blank">a GNN interview with Noam Chomsky</a>. I'm always torn when it comes to Chomsky. I disagree with a number of his fundamental premises about the world we live in, but I have the utmost respect for the way he approaches the political landscape. He's not a 'Professional Political Commentator,' but then who is? I find myself wondering what sort of crackheaded qualifications one might need to be what amounts to a 'professional opinion-holder.' It would be nice to see people from a variety of viewpoints approaching things with the same personal intensity and dedication that Chomsky brings, and the same intellectual rigorousness. Sadly, the academic intellectual aspects of the game seem to be eclipsed by sound bites and white papers more and more.

Anyhow. One of the interesting points he makes near the end of the interview related to the Old Testament. while I'm turned off by his summarization of Biblical prophecy as 'ancient geopolitical commentary by the intellectuals of the day' he makes an excellent point. In the Bible, when advisors played to the king's strengths, fawned, and pandered... we called them false prophets.
