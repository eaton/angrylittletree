Forget about that godawful Will Smith movie. Men In Black are not suave human heroes is sharp suits here to fight against aliens. The actual MIB are human but not-quite beings, who often appear after major UFO sightings to try and find out how much the witness saw, and to suggest they do not tell anyone about anything, often threatening them or saying that they're making it up.
