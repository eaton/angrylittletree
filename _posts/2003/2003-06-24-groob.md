Midnight at the office, with most excellent music drifting in the headphones. A good night out with the gang. Interesting discussions. An emergency dash to Borders with <a href="http://rdecker.livejournal.com">rdecker</a>. (Mmmmm, Cowboy Bebop. The movie. On DVD.) Laughing with Carrie and Kathy and <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> and <a href="http://danamore.livejournal.com">danamore</a> and Kimmy and <a href="http://humblepen7.livejournal.com">humblepen7</a> and the whole gang.

And now, updating the objectschema.xml file to get a new class association working. Work should always be like this. Dark and uninterrupted and set to an excellent soundtrack.

(and <a href="http://petey77.livejournal.com">petey77</a>, too. I KNEW I'd missed a name!)
