May it be said that electroclash is simply the best genre of music in the world. Perhaps in several worlds.

I realize that my feelings are influenced heavily by the fact that I'm listening to one of the best tracks Felix da Housecat has ever produced, and the deep throbbing bass is pleasantly crunching itself into my skull. But I think my analysis will, in fact, stand the test of time.

Viva electroclash!
