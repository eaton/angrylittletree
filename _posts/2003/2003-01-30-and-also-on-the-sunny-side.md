Wednesday, <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> came over to chill while I played insurance company phone tag and kept up on events at the office via phone and IM. It was good. He did some reading, we cashed in for 100 megs of chopped loops and samples from <a href="http://www.primesounds.com/" target="_blank">PrimeSounds,</a> and he started work on some <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com" target="_blank">havana</a>-themed <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/havana02.wav" target="_blank">electro</a> stuff. Lots of latin guitar picking and afro-cuban drum loops. I approve.

When recreation time rolled around, we played <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps2/warofthemonsters" target="_blank">War Of The Monsters</a> for a while. Nothing's quite as fun as a brawler game that pits <a href="http://www.avia-art.com/godzilla.html" target="_blank">Godzilla</a> against <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/sc/enforcer/" target="_blank">Tranzor Z</a>. Rarrr.
