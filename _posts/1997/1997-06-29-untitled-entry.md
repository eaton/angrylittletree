Monday blurred -- the rush to finish up work, the surreal nature of the jobs I was doing, and the late-night prepping and packing for the fest itself. That night, Kristin and I exchanged a flurry of emails and AOL Instant Messages trying to work out how we'd meet up once we get to the fest. It's a little like telling a friend that you'll be in Chicago over the weekend, and hopefully you'll see them sometime... We decided on a couple key concerts and other places to hook up, and hoped for the best.

"I'll be wearing pigtails and a pink tank-top."

"I'll be wearing an Echoing Green T-shirt and carrying a Super Soaker XP2500. Shouldn't be hard to spot..."

"Use it on me, and I'll kill you Jeff."

Still... Tempting.
