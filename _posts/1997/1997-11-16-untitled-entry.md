so i've been horribly lax. sue me? since nate left things have been.... different. i'm not sure how to describe it, but there's a certain sense of loneliness that comes with the knowledge that friends are drifting in different directions and not much can be done to stop it.

i suppose that's not true. not really, at least. i /can/ keep in touch, and i /can/ make an effort to reach out. i suppose it feels like i'm sitting here in a bottle, floating in an ocean of relationships -- dry, watching it through the glass.

i went to a concert with seth and jason tonight; sixpence none the richer. woo woo... leigh was 'mazin as expected. but it's a bit difficult to see them drawing a small crowd. with the delay and the REX problems (they went 2 years with no touring and no new releases), they're all but starting fresh in terms of name recogition. and that 'new band' experience is no picnic. their new stuff is good, though -- it counjours up images of greenery, or -- perhaps -- sepia tones.

got a photo of matt slocumb and leigh with squeaky. taunted Miss Angie about her doll-head collection ('So, you're saying you keep the bodies in the silver drawer? Pity guests looking for a spoon...') talked with jason about whether or not sherri shaw's outfit was indicative of a return to the 70s or a new cyber-chic motif that draws in certain elements of 70's fashion while maintaining its own distinct look. Sort of a goth/blade runner/raver hippie look. she was wearing /all/ black, from platform shoes to bellbottoms to her lycra top. no one in the 70s ever wore all-black vinyl...

haven't heard from kristin in pushing three weeks. i'm selfish, i suppose. my first thought on realizing that was, "ouch." concern /followed/. but needless to say... I'm concerned. concerned and somewhat resigned. there's nothing that I can /do/ about it other than pray for her, which i have done in abundance... but when it comes down to it she chooses what she choses.
