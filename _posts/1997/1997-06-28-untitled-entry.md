Just a few days 'fore the fest. Four of us (Dawn, Beck, Jason, and I) headed out for a massive shop-fest. Meet at my house, and blew off for Eddie Bauer with a small wad of cash to check out new backpacks. We got a great deal on the new ones ($20 instead of $45) and planned how we would keep Dew in the side-pouches.

Dawn and Beck got distracted while Jason and I lusted for giant over-the-shoulder duffelbags. Very Caleb.

Jammed to Walmart for the basic supplies -- Sunblock (check, SPF 30), insect repellant (check, citronella wipes), batteries (in abundance), bottled water (mucho), fire boots (Bwaha!), earplugs (bingo, -29dB), flashlight (my brinkman), watch (got it), juice boxes (many and varied), combos (augh! we couldn't find them! gotta get 'em atta gas station), pretzels (snyders, raided from our cupboard), pop (24 pack of Dew, but of course), rain ponchos (the little ones), a plastic tarp (nabbed from the garage), fruit (nabbed later), and... granola bars! Yahooooooo. We even got ones with 'Natural' in the name so they could be healthy.

We cruised around Wal-Mart looking psychotic. Toyed with cameras and drooled for the ELPH form-factor cases, looked at headphones and stuff... Picked up Pez, in honor of the usagi pez dispenser that Kristin gave me in the box long long ago. Stopped by the water toys aisle, and got hopelessly distracted looking at stuff. I pointed to one box. "Hey! Jase! It's an Elmo-branded Bong!"

Jason stared at the box. "Woah. You're right!"

It ended up being a sprinkler, but it was a frightening look-alike, especially on the box art. I discovered the Super Soaker XP 2500, the world's most impressive water weapon. A gallon tank, a huge pump chamber... a SHOULDER HARNESS! It has three selectable nozle sizes for variable bursts. It rocks. It screams 'Vasquez' at the top of its molded plastic lungs and looks good doing it. Unfortunately it was more expensive than we first thought. Though it was marked $12 on the rack (mucho bargain) it rang up as thirty bucks. Le siiigh! I grudgingly drug it over to the customer service aisle and returned it as bystanders ooh and aahhh. Funny thing is, the guy working the counter was gonna be going to Cstone, too. He asked what I'd be using it for, and voila... another link. What is it? Cstoners are everywhere!

So then we headed to Toys R Us and looked there; same price unfortunately. Ah, well. The Bavarian Inn followed, and we plopped down there anticipating a good German meal. We were not disappointed -- giant hunks of breaded mushroom from God's own hand, and HUGE intimidating plates of roast pork, potato pancakes, chicken, pickles, shrimp, applesauce, dumplings... geeze! Dawn and Beck picked at shrimp while Jason and I refused to be bested by the Portions of Doom.

Finally I admitted defeat and packed up a doggie bag. Jason gorged himself on a chicken sandwich bigger than his head, and we all waddled out after leaving a good tip. GAH! We must visit when we're hungrier sometime...

We finished it up with a trip to the grocery store. A dozen bags of lemonheads. Marshmallow Fluff. The biggest bag of Lays ever known to man... that kind of stuff. After much debate we decided that a single 24-pack of Dew would be okay for the two of us for four days... but we were still uncertain. Dawn and Beck sat on the floor in one of the aisles while Jason and I raced grocery carts.
