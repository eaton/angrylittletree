otaking.org was cracked. they took it down to rebuild it with actual security. david wanted to find the culprit "Sharp hooks and acid, all the way." but it'd just be a witch hunt.

Nate and I have been talking more about deeper things.. which i'm glad about. i'm also rediscovering the fact that he's a frighteningly good strategist. he rips you to shreds in myth. I want to play him one on one though, since tonight i learned a LOT about 'if i had a trow' capture the flag :-) actually did well, coming in first place :)

other matters... got things settled with david davoust. i'm editor. i'm pulling together some articles. oy. nate has quieted about that. we went to taco bell the other night... ended up discussing the top five typecast-able roles in christian music and home videos:

5. The well-meaning but oblivious parent
4. The gratuitous joke-cracker in the car after the party...
3. The tough as nails coach who really /does/ care...
2. The streetsmart skateboarder looking for something more...
1. Rent-A-Homie!

well... you get the picture. we had a bit of a blast joking around, things like that.

it's feeling strange. the whole experience with Christine is starting to feel less like 'current angst' and more like 'a story.' one of those things that I /remember/. and tell people about when we're discussing bad relationship moves.

i logged onto a talker... geh. guys hitting on people incessantly. met some intersting people, though. a guy named 'pooroldlu', woohoo! also met someone named 'tigerlily' who ends up being a diehard machead, poet and all that jazz. we talked for quite a while... enjoyed it a lot. her poetry... oy. hard hitting stuff. one of them, 'I don't want to be a fool for you...' It's a song about making a fool of yourself; not in big huge ways, but in the gestures, the attempts to be casual, to manuever yourself into someone's attention when you so desperately want to know and be known by them... ouch. among other things we spent a lot of time talking about the virtues of various snacks. crackers, pretzels... and OOoooohhh, dill pickles. /yes/. after coming up with yummy sounding ideas and things like that we were both grinning and she commented that it was nice to be able to just talk to a guy like that; most of th epeople that she's talked to, she said, had some kind of thing about how girls shouldn't /enjoy/ eating. weird.

also met someone named meganmelissa. random questions went back and forth; she asked what my favorite smell was. I answered, the sound of pancakes baking... because that's what i remember of the brunches and things like that that dad would make us sunday mornings when we all crawled out. long, long ago... she also thought purple sounded like children plaing and being happy -- off in the distance. then she answered... first, she said christmas cooking.. the memories of her mother and helping out with all that. then she made me promise not to laugh; she had another, too. I promised... and she said, 'Drakor.' the cologne. Why? Because it's the scent her first date ever wore... she wore his sport coat home that night and then slept with it under her pillow, because it smelled of Drakor... and that was /him/. she accused me of laughing; I felt like i was talking to molly ringwald or something. i melted over on the other side ofthe monitor... it was just too sweet for words.

debugging session as they tried to correct the problems on otaking... the old wackiness is still there.
