We woke up late -- 11ish -- and not willingly. Lynelle blasted into the room with Beck in tow, dropped off muffins, and threw open the curtains. Auuuuggh! Too bright! Ben grumbled sleepy obscenities at her as she opened the curtains wider, and made an ineffective swipe at her. He finally collapsed back, face down. The rest of us gave in. No use fighting two members of the opposite sex determined to wake you up.

Especially if they've got muffins.

When they finally cleared out -- with threats of immanent return -- Dan mumbled over to Ben. "Frankly, man, your language offended me." Ben snored theatrically. One by one we crawled to the shower before they returned, and a great debate ensued over how exactly they got in. After discussion of possible duplicate keys, Jason finally confessed to opening the door. Ben tried to strangle him but was still too tired.

After that was resolved, we headed en masse to the 'family style resturant' next door. Mushroom sticks and omlettes and chicken salad sandwiches and pancakes -- good stuff, no question.

We all hung out for a while -- reluctant to leave behind the air conditioned hotel room with its two fluffy beds and a shower sans sewage. Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey was on so we aaaalll sacked out and watched it. Beck was off to the fest early but Lynelle hung back to see the movie. I came up with the idea for a perfect Christian T-shirt. "Get Saved: Give Death A Wedgie."

Jason and I partook of the heater meals. with much fanfare, we tore open the boxes, mixed in the little water packets... and watched, unnerved, as chemical-reaction steam curled out of the boxes for fifteen minutes. I looked up at Lynelle with a hesitant expression.

"That's just not right, Jeff. Boxes shouldn't do that."

Turns out, though, that they were actually pretty good. Jason took the Country style chicken entree and I nabbed the mashed potatos and beef with gravy. Liberties were taken with the photos on the boxes, to say the least, but the meat-looking substance inside actually tasted pretty good when hot. After scarfing them down, I pulled on a 'Body Piercing Saved My Life' t-shirt, tossed Dew and CDs and lemonheads into my backpack, kicked dirty clothes into a pile, and joined the rest of the gang in Ben's van.
