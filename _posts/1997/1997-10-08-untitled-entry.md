a full week has passed since i last scribbled words into my diary. hopefully it won't be a portent. i've actually come to enjoy the whole diary thang.

what's happened lately? eh. quite a bit, actually... enough to make me marvel at the acceleration of life.

* kristin fell in love with an ass

* Nate came home

* More stuff with David Davoust

* Had an interesting, almost dream-like conversation with Tero and Tari

* The eigth came and went; a full month since the package arrived. Ouch? Yes, Ouch.

* My last day at Motorola. Oif. Al Rust boiled my blood. Long Story(tm).
