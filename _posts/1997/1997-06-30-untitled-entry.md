work zoomed by, and I burnt rubber home, jumping a couple curbs to gain time. T-18 hours to Cornerstone. Spent the time packing and organizing -- called Jason and we synced our payloads.

"Okay. You're bringing CDs, right Jason?"

"Definitely."

"I've got mostly electronica and progressive rock. Can you handle hardcore and industrial?"

"Perfect! I've already got my Stavesacre collection packed."

"I'm bringing disc one of the Virus double set. Can you spot the second one, and haul along Aleixa's Honey Lake?"

"Most certainly."

One of the great debates revolved around whether to use my old grubby backpack, known for injuring people when I turn around too fast, or the new spiffy one from Eddie Bauer. The presence of a special mesh pouch for an emergency can of Dew finally tipped the scales in favor of the new one. I packed it with ponchos and handi-wipes and tape recorders and notepads and pens and flashlights and tape measurers. And CDs. Don't forget the CDs!

Dad tossed me a secret weapon for the fest -- a kludged-together power adapter for the Powerbook that clips straight to a car battery. Very cool hack. All we need to do is pop the car's hood when we need to dump photos from the camera!

I spent about fifteeen minutes printing up fun signs to use at the fest, and covering them with packing tape to protect them from the elements.

I finally collapsed around two in the morning: the pile of stuff in the living room is enormous, and I kept thinking of little things to add to it before I fell asleep.
