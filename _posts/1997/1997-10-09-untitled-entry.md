got a call from david davoust, and... ker-blink. he wants me to be the editor of the magazine, and i'm meeting him monday to talk about it.

nate then bamfed over to the house... and the majority of the day was spent catching up, being a little bit awkward, and other things such as that.

nate shot down ministry online in a multi-magazine burst that left me blinking hard. we talked some. went out for taco bell, came back, played marathon infinity netgames that lagged horribly because of the powerbook's crappy crappy network performance. still, it wasn't bad if i put it on super ultra low res. marathon is simply /not/ a game that you can expect decent performance from. oy!
