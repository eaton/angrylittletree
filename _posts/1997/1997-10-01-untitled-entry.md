i woke up feeling vaguely fuzzy-headed, trudged off to work and finished my letter to Erin Burke. i made a slight change to the poem i wrote yesterday... i've titled it, tentatively...

"on sunlight and interstates"
-
bright weightless fingers
brush my skin
i smile
eyes closed as i drink the touch
warm tingling
wind whistling by
the smell of autumn
and diesel
is a shawl


it seems like everyone is having some sort of escapade with matters of love; kristin, lisa, steph, tammy, julian, erin burke...

though erin's are closer to mine, she's dealing at least with the prospect of someone else being interested in her. tuesday night's complexities nonwithstanding, i simply don't know how I'm dealing with the matter of Christine. time will tell, I suppose.
