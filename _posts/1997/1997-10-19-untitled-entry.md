nate arrived... around noonish.got down to coding and we were /shocked/ to see how much difference the hand animations make in the general polish factor of the game. it actually looks... well... /good/. 

we ran out to get a sound effects CD for bangs and boinks and squishes. on the way to best buy we ended up talking, and obliqued references to relationships led to a revelation: Nate's in love with Amy from YWAM, and he doesn't think that it's mutual. Or rather, he's so completely clueless about what's going on in her that, well, he doesn't know. "There's a nasty paradox in that I understand her well enough to know that I'll never understand what's going on in her head," he said wryly. I look, and I can see it in his eyes. It hurts. The slight wry quirk of his smile when he mentions her trying to put an ironic twist on what's simply a hurt. She won't give him "A straight answer," he says... but he doesn't know what he /is/ to do. Later I mentioned my last relationship was at 12 with rochelle wagler, and we all know how healthy /that/ was. He looked over and smirked at me. "Well, you've got one up on /me/."

I suppose so.

On the flip side he actually was able to spend quite a bit of time with her. am i jealous? yeah.

i'm jealous of nate's angst, because there's an actual relationship behind it.

me? i'm so fucking pathetic that i fall for a woman i don't know, that i've talked to for maybe two hours, who could be engaged for all i know. i didn't /do/ anything stupid, but that doesn't matter. it's what I /felt/ that makes me so angry. Why did I /let/ myself?
