Oy. It's been an... interesting day. Jason and I woke up around 8:30ish and listened to the electrics to help wake up. We set about re-arranging the stash of all the stuff we packed. Indeed, fortune favors the prepared! We reshuffled everything and got more ice, then started preparing to make a tarp/awning. Deacon and Danny showed up and while Deacon dumped the latest batch of Photos, the rest of us found the woods and felled a small tree with a swiss army knife and a multi-tool. Voila! Poles for the awning! On the downside, a bottle of water got spilled into Mel and... Mel is... well... non-bootable. Unresponsive.

4:35pm... Just praying about what's up with the things that are going on. [The death of Mel and my camera, the hotel, everything... just all the stuff that's hitting the fan]. The only things that come to mind are these... That when we're careless, our vision is darkened. The camera got dropped, and it went dark. Can it be repaired? I don't know. The second is a little more interesting. I don't know if it's Him or no, but I feel like He was saying that...  He witholds His power until we've cleaned up our lives... the spills, the messes, things that may not seem like much everydayare disasters when 'current' is flowing. Shorts, destroyed circuits, etc. I don't know what He has in mind, but I hope it's important.

6:25. Whew. After an up and down sort of thing, I'm cool. Pam and Joyce and I prayed about some stuff. Going to see the Electrics in about 35 minutes with Kristin and Dawn.

8:46 pm... Wow! The Electrics were really great. The three of us sat on the hill and watched as they just *blew* through an awesome set. The finished up with Psalm 23... and unexplainable a little cross that said 'God Saves' on it dropped next to Kristin. She picked it up and blinked muchly. Ummmm.

3:27am... An interesting evening as they go. The Waiting played a really good set, though I'm not sure how it compares to their other shows. Afterwards, voila! Sixpence! Kristin and Dawn were mucho happy. (They had even gone down to jig during the Electrics...)

After Sixpence, the three of us walked back, and talked a bit, etc. We hugged and parted ways. And so it was.

I wandered for a while, and caught Savior Machine with Ben and his gang. Very interesting, but packed. Blech!

Hooked up with Cappuccino girl after getting separated from Jason; she'd taken 5 rolls of film already. Walked around with her and her friends, etc. Finally, around 3-ish, we went to the car and I crashed.

Friday. It's just not the fest anymore without Kristin. Bleh! The RMC picnic rocked, though. Usenetters everywhere! Peter Thompson and I went shopping afterwards and I picked up some good cheap stuff. I tried to call Kristin and Dawn before the picnic a their hotel room but the phone ate my change. Thhhppbbttt.

Then? Well... I wandered a lot. Saw it rain, traded mock-insults with MC Hammer fans, etc. Talked to Joey Belville and made it by some other booths. Ramsie Shick was AMAZING! Ani Difranco-esque. Ran into Ben and his friends again; the day kind of blurs together. We made it to Mainstage, and saw Deleriou5, or some of it at least.

Then.... The Echoing Green! Joy Electric rocked. They started out the show by filling the tent with smoke and strobing it. I got up front and put in the earplugs and *thrashed*! Joy E. opened with an interesting and challenging comment about the need to challenge artists, to not just suck stuff up. Then launched into a cool Aphex Twin-ishunreleased song that'll be on his next CD. His voice was so-so but the music rocked. Then! The Echoing Green! Joey *ruled* and did a new song called 'defender' that truly kicked.

After the concert, etc, Jason and Dawn and I hooked up... then at the end of the night we [Jason, Ben, Ben's friend, and I] got a motel room and the four of us sacked out. It was good.
