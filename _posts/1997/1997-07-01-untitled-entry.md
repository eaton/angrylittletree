Blink blink. I'm supposed to be meeting Kristin in 30 seconds or so, and we're still stuck in the line. I try to dump photos from the camera to the powerbook and it's dead, completely. The camera must've gotten dropped because every photo that's taken is completely black. Further attempts to fiddle with it are useless, and with time ticking away, I have to write it off. My plans to document the fest are put on hold, but there's no time to think about it for now.

I look from side to side, peer out the window, and sling my backpack over my shoulder. "Jason -- catch you at the Industrial Tent at nine. Cool?"

"Cool."

We share a look and I jump out of the car before he has a chance to park. I sprint down the dirt road that runs its way through the whole 500+ acres of the fest, whipping out my secret weapon: a giant folded-up sign that reads 'Kristin' on one side and 'Usagi' on the other. As I approach the meeting place -- the giant gravel pit next to the public showers -- I whip open the sign and hold it above my head. Off in the distance, a girl with pigtails and a pair of funky yellow-tinted shades double-takes and laughs out loud.

Kristin.
