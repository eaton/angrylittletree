oy, what all has /happened/?  lots. Nate's leaving. soon.

Nate was sick from friday through sunday, down for the count and we didn't really hit anything on Teatime. Today he was feeling better, so he headed over and we sacked out, watched Gross Point Blank (very good film, more to follow on that), headed to taco bell and ate. And talked. About life, future directions, "remembering the 90's" and love in general. Oy.

I think there's something distinctive about this generation (yes, everyone thinks that about their generation, but humor me, please)... We've been so overloaded with waves of prepackaged nostalgia for /other/ generations (Sounds of the 60's! Great memories of the 70's... Trivial Pursuit: the 80's Edition!) that we have the unique ability to perceive the present as history. We can look at something happening right at this very moment and figure out how it would fit into a mail-order collection of "Great Moments Of The Nineties." It's like eulogizing someone while they're sitting there talking to you.

We decided that Sienfeld, The X-Files, and Power Rangers would be some of the defining TV moments. Desert Storm would be the "Al Capone's Vault" of the nineties, and Taco Bell and Mountain Dew would be the official foods. "The Nineties are the decade when Pepsico decided to actually promote Taco Bell and make it hip," Nate asserted. I wondered aloud if CBN could do that with Pat Robertson. "You know... Pat Unplugged, or something like that." Nate stared, wide-eyed, over his tablefull of soft tacos, and the subject shifted rapidly to other matters. (We didn't mention Tamagotchi or whatever those hellish little electronic chickens are called. We can still hope they'll pass.)

I asked what he had in mind for the next several years, and his answer flip-flopped between "You think *I* know?" and "Grand emperor of the universe with my own space armada." After some poking and prodding, he explained that his plan for the coming 18 months consisted of "Working at Logicware, paying off debt, getting a car, and chasing Amy." Works for me. Half of me wished I had someone to chase, and the other half keeps telling me, "You dip. If you do /that/ you'll have to do something productive with your life, and you don't seem capable of it at the moment." Oy. Ick.

In other news, I related the story of Kristin's response to Nate. "The only thing more painful," I said, "Than having someone you care about ditch you because you said what you felt would help them... is having them honestly thank you and give you a hug, but still ignore every word of it." I guess the female of the species isn't the only one attracted to screwed-up-ness. Huzzah.

ordered my PC. 'Welcome to the Gateway family...'
