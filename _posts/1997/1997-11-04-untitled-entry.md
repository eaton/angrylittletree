Nate was over for a little while. Didn't accomplish tons, unfortunately, but he was only here for a little while. Changeling article got finished, and I finally sent it in (laaaate!). Mom got to hear the updates on the Kristin story, which I'd forgotten to give to her. Eich.

Her comment, an amazingly annoyingly observant thing it was. "Are you romantically attracted to her?" Well, thanks mom, for just driving the knitting needle into my chest cavity. I figured, wtf, why not. so we chatted for a while and Mom was actually quite cool and perceptive about it. That we have a lot (and I mean a lot) in common in terms of interests, gripes, and loves for chatting about certain kinds of things. A flair for the melodramatic, even. Shut up, Jeff, you're starting again. I explained to her my personal vow about not having her as any more than a friend or tossing the possibility from my mind no matter what it is that happens with her salvation, her bad-guy-burr tendencies, and other such things.

It's all internal semantics, of course, since I'd have to burn my lips off with a P2 to avoid asking her out if we ever did reach common ground as far as our beliefs go. But as I hinted at with Mom, I didn't want mixed motives to be there in the things that I did for her. I didn't want to share the truth with her in hopes that she would one day "come around" and see that I'd been the one who really cared. It's a selfish, underhanded, manipulative way of operating, and it wouldn't be any better than what other people do and I rip on. but I ramble. The encouraging thing is that the only few people I've talked to about it have univerally agreed that it was a Cool Thing. Of course, they were guys.

i made contact with China Blue, Queen of Rain. We'd passed each other in the night a few times and this time we actually got to sit down for a while and /talk/. It was nice...
