Friday: On the road again... just can't wait to get on the road again... After ten long hours on the road we arrived at the American Inn. Frightening, hyper-patriotic place... Massive old glory flying outside, something like thirty feet long. Entire massive sprawling complex is lit up like Vegas with red white and blue neon... Massive sign out front: "WELCOME, SPIRiTUALISTS! OPEN TO THE PUBLIC..."  Wheeeeee! Room reeks of paint... hallways are plush, but littered with empty beer bottles set in the ashtrays... Signs on the walls point the way to 'FREEDOM HALL!' It's sort of a 'We eat our cows alive here, son, y'all gotta pra'wlem with that?' sort of place. Wild. Second room doesn't reek but -- GAH! The phone is /hard wired/ into the wall. What is it? The 70's or something? :-) Definite no-go.

2:00 AM. We're on the road and searching for a place to crash. T-45 minutes to my 20th birthday... It's the weekend. In a gambling town. There /are/ no rooms. But lo and behold, there's actually a free place -- for this night only -- at the budgetell inn. Great place. One bed. I sacked in the recliner with a blanket. Managed to jack in, dial into AOL, and telnet into my WWA account. Tried to fire something off to Bart... lost consciousness in the recliner as I turned twenty. Things are looking a bit bleak.

Saturday: Woke up 3 hours after collapsing to the insistent chirping of the hotel alarm clock. We're out of the room -- someone else's got a reservation on it. So, we're in a new place. Much better, with a microwave and the works... Heading into the conference, and things are looking up! Great room, checked it out before we went to the conf.... phone line, private microwave and fridge... woohoo!

Saturday Afternoon: Wonderful room. Only problem with the room is that it's got roaches falling outof the walls, is located next to a sewage retention levy, andwas just Orkin'd a week ago. /Smell/ them carcinogens, girl! Still trying to find another place, but nobody's got open rooms and the weekday rates are absofreakinglutely obscene. Things are looking bleak again, and it's only 8 hours since I've arrived. God help us if it gets /worse/.

Sam Storms impressed me. Talked about the need for a good grounding in the theology and the Bible -- the 'solid' stuff to match the 'revelation and illumination' that we see a lot of in the Prophetic movement. Without that, he says, it will be derailed. Amen. The conference center is a gorgeous eroding 1940's tribute to art deco.

Saw the Trosts. Found... THE BOOKSTORE!  Good grief. This place is amazing. Tables and tables of stuff. 50% off CDs and more off some of the books. They've got /obscure/ stuff! Prayer Chain's Mercury, Circle Slide, some old Mortal stuff, PFR, heck, even two starflyer CDs tucked in a corner! Way cool. Still, it's a bit of a momentary distration fromthe fact that we probably don't have a place to /stay/ come tonight. Wish I had the money to snag some of the CDs...

Paul Cain spoke. Some people seemed disappointed that he didn't do the big "Call out people and predict their future" thing, but he had great stuff to say. /Important/ stuff to say. "God knows." We don't need to obsess about details when we know that he will revela to us the things that we /need/ to know. We don't need to feel obligated to tell everything we do to the whole world, either... sometimes, it's enough that 'God knows.'

Ran into Ben, and a bunch of his friends. That was cool.

I found a nice way-up-high-in-the-bleachers kinda place to sack out and read while everyone's busy listening to the speakers. No dice on a power outlet, though. /Everything/ is a twist-lock outlet! Grr.

Saturday night: Someone named Shelly Hanson offered to let us stay at her house. I lapsed into abject depression; my week of relaxation and solitude turned into a 24-hour marathon of room changes, culminating in a week-long stay at a stranger's house where I'll have no net access, and likely no privacy to sit down and write. So much for my interview? Exhausted and spent emotionally after a heated discussion with Mom. She asked me what I thought aboutthe whole thing and refused to accept polite and nice answers about the deal. Finally told her what I thought about everything -- the trip, the room, the works, then collapsed back on the bed.

Helped pack the car in pouring rain. Spent the 30-minute drive soaked and huddled in the back seat around 1:30 AM, clutching a TWIX bar from a vending machine outside the motel. Pulled into Shelly's driveway. Walked in the door, soaked to the bone and looking like the living dead, a couple leaad-filled bags turning my spinal column into an avant garde sculpture. Girl pokes her head up over the couch, hair mussed from fitful sleep, and blinks at me somnolently. "Oh. Hi."

Apparently there are other people sacked out here, too...

Sunday, 2AMish: Girl is from Minnesota; I was sacked out alone on a couch in the basement with a throw blanket, stripped to my shorts so I wouldn't freeze to death, and she trudged down the stairs and camped out on the couch across from me. "They're still talking up there," she apologized. No big deal, and I said as much. Introduced myself. We talked for a bit before losing consciousness; her family does the conference thing in a big way... she's a lifer. Cute, in a jaded sort of way... that whole looking-vulnerable-while-asleep thing. Could just be that I was exhausted, too.

Sunday Morning: Oog. Wasn't a dream. I manage to regain consciousness and stumble upstairs too late to make it to the Sunday morning service. Hey, no condemnation and all that jazz.

Wild place, the Hanson house. Talked a bit with a couple of the guys. They're trying to annihilate each other in Tecmo Bowl on the NES. Joe is frighteningly good at it. They al knoweach other from an 8-month stint with Master's Commission. Sort of a monestary meets a college, with outreach and ministry work tossed into the pot. Odd man out == Jeff.

Tonight's the first day of the Passion For Jesus deal rather than the Prophetic Conference...  Went to the evening session, as things kicked off.

Ran into Ben and Company again. Still searching for outlets. Bah! Bah, I say. Ben ran into a girl he knew -- she looked at me, and I recognized her. "Hey, aren't you..." "Yeah, I'm the unconscious guy in the basement." "Hey! Cool!" Ben stared at us oddly. He and she ran off and left the rest of us walking towards the bleachers; we joked that, "Yeah... one woman comes along, and we're history!"

We all sacked out in the bleachers and such, guy who spoke was fun. Intersting. Not very coherent in what he was getting at, but... I liked some of the stuff he said. Insert witticisms here. "You can't act in faith if you haven't HEARD from God about it. Acting 'in faith' if you haven't heard from him is acting *in*the*flesh*..."

Got home. Chatted with her a bit. She likes techno.

Monday: No dice on Changeling. Calling all through the day, no answer. I'm writing it off as a loss, sadly. :/ I don't think there's much I can do beyond that. So, when I get back I'll work things out with Bart. I think it would be a lot better for IMG if I were to just write articles, none of this 'regular column' stuff... Sad but true.

Met Lavonne today. Wow, this woman is a dynamo. What, sixtysomething? Acts like she's twenty. She owns no house, no car, no nothing. "Lives by faith" as it were as she travels around the world. Missionary to Japan. Has stories about God pulling through in the nick of time that make you laugh for hours. God has a sense of humor, no question 'tall. A real card, and a woman who helps prove that God can't possibly be stuffy.

Still searching for power -- snark. I found a spotlight cage up along the balcony that has a single 3-prong outlet... ye-ah! Only problem is that the cage is heavy duty steel and locked. Spent a few fruitless minutes trying to reach the outlet, 6 feet from the cage's edge. Hmmmmmmm.

Monday: Jack Deere rocks hard. Guy's message this afternoon was about the love of Christ. Living out His love with those around us. "So what if they don't become Christians? We should love them just as much as those who do." It's amazing how encouraging it is to hear someone who is able to mirror my very beliefs in their messages. Like I said, he rocks. :-)

Went to some health food store and picked up a bunch of grub for Mom and Dad during the break. I snagged a pint of Heath Bar Crunch and a slice of cheesecake. Mom and Dad spontaneously footed the bill -- happy birthday to me! I downed it while listening to... Drum roll please. John Arnott.

Suprisingly, Mister Toronto struck me as really reasonable, well-grounded, and genuinely compassionate. Not exploitative in the least, and even reluctant to see the 'weirder' manifestations. His opinions were appreciated, and I came away feeling quite pleased about the fact that he's out there preaching the word. It's not what I expected.

I beat my all-time high score in Swoop during a slow part of his message... it was a total Zen experience. 100% accuracy on the first wave and nothing below 85% for the rest of the game. I was one with the little 26x32 pixel ship.

Wandered over and talked to Dave Grimes for about an hour. Encouraging, pleasant conversation. Honesty, transparency and life DO exist out there. God, I want to move to Kansas.

Monday night: Well.. back at the ranch el wacko...

Lavonne was telling more stories, and laughing at a couple comments I made. She likes odd humor, she says. Im' her man, then... She said she wants me to write her book. Uhoh.

Four more people have arrived and the basement just got a lot more crowded... Another girl, too, sister of one of the guys and a darkly jaded looking gal with raven-black hair and a faint tattoo on her upper arm. She's got a wan smile, tired looking eyes, and features like a delicate slavic pixie; like she's not happy to be here but knows people want her to be. I found out her Mom wants her going to school in the area 'cause it's safer. She wants to move to Florida.

As we got ready to turn in for bed the canadian dude wanted to show us his video of him skydiving. "What a rush!" he's fun.. enthusiastic to a fault and a /massive/ dude. Square-jawed and six-foot-something, powerful build and the open, innocent face that makes you smile just talking to him. Every night the guys have massive duels with Tecmo Bowl football on the NES in the basement. I'm trapped in a house full of jocks. Hulp!

Tuesday: Woohoo! I've got power! After days of fruitless searching, I stumbled across a live outlet with a standard plug! I sacked out in the middle of one of the big hallways, slapped in my Cloud 2 Ground CD -- screw it, there are people shouting in tongues at the top of their lungs, my techno CD ain't gonna matter. ;)  I sat down on the floor with my precious copy of Tozer's Attributes of God and dug in. Tozer /rocks/ my world. I like this guy. immanenently siggable.

Then plunked down to do some writing on MO stuff. Fruitful and fun. A Mac dude stopped by to cheer me on. "Dude! That's a Powerbook. I love my 7300, man... keep the faith..." Tres spiff. Got myself a killer Edys' cone. I love those people. I was feeling rather better by this time -- if you hadn't already figured it out. :-j I skipped almost everything inside the conference after the praise and worship stuff. Just sacked out and wrote and thought and pondered and read and took random photos of the place. It was refreshing.

Went outside to grab myself a pack of shock tarts and talked to a street vendor. "What do you think of all this?" She was a Baptist, she said -- goes to a pretty reserved church. "A lot of people seem really... excited," she offered, head tilted to the side and smiling faintly.

"Yeah. Yeah, they are."

Tuesday Evening: Dude. Met Conrad, a UCLA student who skipped out on college last year to go through masters commission. Hit by a car a few months ago, and miraculasly survived when the two other people in the car were killed in the collision. One of the women watching said that he /floated/ out of the car like he was being carried, and landed gently on the ground. He should've been thrown out, was wearing only his shorts, no shirt, and came away with minor bruises and some scrapes. One of the people who arrived on the scene had a chopper called in because he wasn't breathing, and had a hole in his head -- literally... When he got to the hospital, the doctor shrugged. "Only took nine stiches to sew him up, the hole wasn't there any more..." He listens to dance music exclusively. Corad's cool.

Mike Bickle's sermon, hmm. I missed it, but it seems like everything I've heard is that he's going through something moby. Something impatient, almost, an irritation and a frustration that comes through in his speaking and his dealings. perhaps it's got something to do with what I just was listening to on the tapes of his sermon -- about the Lord telling him years ago that his impatience would end up hurting people. Kind of spooky, really...

More talking to Lavonne. Maybe this book thing isn't a bad idea. Good grief, she's got a lot of wild stories. It could be fun reading.

New girl arrived, three more guys. Girl is an art student, loves to paint. Seems more serene than the other two girls I've run into here, softer. One guy's cool, thirty year old dude on crutches (bone spur surgery) who's the manager of the newmedia group for an HMO. Talked geekstuff with him for a little while. Geeze. Crowded basement now. Six people stuffed in here.

Wednesday...  Well. Today's the day to sack out and relax. I hung around, re-read the first few chapters of Snow Crash and the like. Woo woo. :) Helped Shelly pack up some packages to go out, things like that... hung around with the guys and talked a litle bit. Soaked up some quality male bonding time and played golf on the NES  -- got creamed. Seriously creamed. But hey, it was fun.

Getting to know a few of the guys here -- just a bit -- and it's cool. Listened to some music and talked a bit and things like that. More talking.

Come evening everyone clears out save the under-30 crowd. I hung out downstairs with the guys while they played Tecmo Bowl and golfed and I challenged Zoop to a game. It was a draw, I think.

Wednesday Night: The Miss Teen USA pageant came on and I found two of the girls watching it as I went upstairs for a drink. Art Student and Jaded Raven-haired girl. They were busy laughing their heads off at the whole thing and ripping it to pieces, MST3K style. "Oh God... To think that I could've had all that!" *insert female laughter* I sidled up and chuckled a bit. Heck, ripping pageants is a passtime but it seems so Alan Alda-ish and cliched if there are females around doing the same thing. I told 'em a bit about Rachel Saunders and Jaded Raven-Hair Girl frowned a bit and nodded. "Yeah... It's kind of sad. Even if they really do want to do something positive... they have to go through all this..." A wave of her hand at the television from her couch-sprawled position.

I wandered downstairs and commented that I want to see a talent show where they have to demonstrate carpentry skills, the ability to field-strip an AK-47, and proficiency with one of the major UNIX shells. Not likely, but it's fun to think about Miss Iowa grepping for the crown.

More Tecmo Bowl and golfing. Cheering at birdies and laughter at the occasional 11-putt hole. "You putted /how/ many times?" "Shut up, man... you're challenging my manhood." 

Everyone cleared out after a couple hours to go to some mutual friend's house, leaving me stranded. I snagged Snow Crash and enjoyed m'self. Then wandered upstairs to discover that Art Student was still hanging out here too. "OK, I'm curious," I asked her after a bit of smalltalk, "What do you think when you see that? The pageant and stuff?" I wanted to know what was up in her head when she was laughing.

She took a few moments to think about it, pursing her lips in a half-smile before offering a slow reply. "I like to understand the things that piss me off... If I didn't see it, it would be ignorance, but when I watch it, I /know/ it's a meat show." She thought for a while longer, head tilted to the side. "I remember being little, my mom and i watching it and getting all excited. But I guess I turned out okay. I just wonder if I'll have to do that with my daughter." She looked at me. "I hope not."

We sat down and talked for pushing two hours. Just friendly, casual discussion that made me smile and give her thumbs up a lot; opinions about love, Christianity, the arts, and all kinds of stuff like that, meshed 100%. But she hates Remains of the Day. Le sigh.

"I can get really passionate about things though," she admitted. "I mean, when I was little I looked at Michaelangelo like guys look at Michael Jordan." She wants to travel around Europe, visit France... doesn't know French but wants to learn it. Wants to paint and write songs that aren't Stained Glass Windows. She kept saying things I was about to say and made me grin at the sameness of the thoughts. 

She pulled me over to listen to her favorite music -- the soundtrack to "The Mission" ... it was /amazing/. Never heard it before, but it was a definite piece of work. Beautiful and haunting, the kind of stuff to write to. A few of her old friends showed up and she went off to hook up with them; after a little while I drifted downstairs and took on Mike, the Canadian Dude, in Tecmo Bowl. He won, 24-27. Not bad for my first game. Everyone got back late... and we all finally collapsed.

Thursday: I finally sat down to re-read The Singer and wept. It's beautiful, and tragic... even moreso because I can see the faces and hearts of the people I know and love in it. I'd forgotten the book's power... or perhaps I'm growing closer to grasp the power of it beyond the religious imagery... it's a story about someone I love and how much he loves me.

I want to buy up a million copies of it, just to have and give. We're heading in this evening to see Paul Cain. Talked to Lavonne s'more. She really wants to do this book thing. I think it could work.

I shouldn't be allowed to wax rhapsodic about beauty. Just something about walking into the living room and finding one of the girls sacked out on the couch, hair a mess, eyes closed, a soft smile on their lips and wrapped up in blanets and pillows and such that pricks that tender spot that makes a guy want to go and kill dragons and clear swamps and stop polio.

Conrad and company got back from golfing. "Conrad /brained/ a guy!" Apparently his aim is pretty good, though he /insists/ that it was an accident hitting that other golfer in the head with his drive. Played Mike in Tecmo Bowl. Lost 49-6. 

A little later in the day I asked Jaded Raven-Haired Girl what she thought about the pageant. What she was thinking when she was there dissing it. "It's embarassing." She shrugged, quirking an odd look at me. "I mean, it's like I can't believe a member of my own /species/ would do that to me... Everything's so focused on looks; magazines, makeup, those--" She flipped a hand at the television. "Then we go out there and that's what we're judged by. Like that's what we want to be or something."

She smiled, more distant and melancholy than amused. "You can't respect something like that. You have to rip it when you see it."

---

Jaded Raven-Haired Girl is no longer. The black is now a sun-streaked shade of brown; she dyed it just before we split for the conference. I arrived there and promptly plonked Mel and my backpack in the upper row and went down to wander; Cher (Swede Woman) was wandering around too, and we bopped around downtown for about half an hour to an hour before things got started. Talked for a while, perched on the three-foot ledge that overlooks the street. It's a beautiful city, really, new and old juxtaposed. Mirror-plated modern nestled beside classic brick, high-reaching and fire-escape trimmed.

Cher enjoys photography, it seems -- likes taking photos around Minneapolis. And, were she able to go anywhere in the world, it would be either Uzbekistan to see the people that she met there with YWAM again, or hiking and backpacking through Europe. Good taste, I think. And anyone who would want to go back to a former Soviet Republic has got chutzpah, IMO. She talked about her family reunions... 150 blonde blue-eyed people running around. "It's an invasion of Swedes or something," she joked. I had visions of Norwegian commandos doing nighttime insertions of Wasa Crispbread into the cupboards of America. Yummily sinister.

Paul Cain... Whew. There's no way to describe it, really. But his 'message' was something that I'd felt, /experienced/ two and a half years ago in the dark of night and pressed down for all that time. No, not pressed down. More like, nurtured. I'll have to think on it more -- but it's made all the tears I've cried in the past few years click into place. They make sense, and they're not so foreign anymore. "We must give the world a taste of the Father for them to have a taste /for/ the Father."

Ran into Lydia Hacker. I got a hug; a word of wisdom; a kiss on the forehead. She is encouragement incarate, I believe. We got home -- Christine (Art Student) hit the sack ten minutes before we got home. Alas, alack. I hung around a while, chatted -- helped do the dishes, things like that. Talked to Shelly about web stuff. "Now, how do they make money on this?" Tried not to laugh and tell her that that's the big /problem/... I asked if Christine would be up early tomorrow. She said she'd leave for school at 8. "Were you the one takling to her about Michaelangelo?" I answered with an affirmative shrug. "Ooohhh... Really? She was very impressed. 'He /talked/ about Michaelangelo!'" Not quite sure how to take that one. Pity I'm leaving tomorrow. :P

Found Cher and snapped a photo of her with Squeaky, after some persuasion.

The Trosts never did end up arriving while I was conscious... Went downstairs, sacked out. After a while I heard noise upstairs and wandered up; Conrad and Mike had just gotten home and wanted to play super tecmo bowl. They'd rented it from funcoland. Conrad beat Mike, I took on Mike and lost 28-0, and Conrad took him again. They watched TV for a bit, and I ended up crawling out to switch it off when they fell asleep.

Friday Morning: Well, here I am in the car, on the way home as scenery sweeps by, blurring into a mottling of passing colors. I woke up late -- 8:30 and missed Christine. NUTS. Wanted to tell her, after our conversation, about The Singer trilogy. I think she'd like them. And, admittedly, I'd wanted to see if she had email. So, as we were packing everything up I scribbled down a note. Said g'bye to Conrad and Mike...

Rewrote the note. First one seemed corny and not natural enough. As luck would have it, Christine got home early! So fore we left I got a chance to talk to her... /and/ get a pic with Squeaky :-) Much to my delight, when I asked if she had email, she said that her school has it but she doesn't know what her address is yet. I gave her mine and said it would be cool if we could keep in touch. Too forward? Maybe. *Shrug* *le sigh* In any case, what's done is done, and I left the note on the counter as well just in case.

Wished Not-Raven-Haired Jaded Girl g'bye and good luck. Told Cher it was cool talking to her, and wished her godspeed in all that lay before her. She smiled and said, "You too!" As we finished packing up and clearing out four more new arrivals showed up -- they'll be staying with her for a while. What a madhouse.

And then, we were out the door. The week was over, and parting is such sweet sorrow.
