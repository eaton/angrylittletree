I've been all kinds of busy for the last several weeks, and haven't bothered posting much to any of the usual spots. Drupal 6's pre-beta cycle is rolling along, though it seems to be a little less purposeful than the last release cycle. It feels a little like the community is waiting for something to happen, without being sure <i>what that something is</i>.



<a href="http://www.growingupgoddy.com"><img src="http://images.websnapr.com/?url=www.growingupgoddy.com&size=S" border=1 align=left hspace=5 /></a> Over the weekend, though, I did manage to put some of the finishing touches on <a href="http://www.growingupgoddy.com">Growing Up Goddy,</a> a group blog for a circle of folks who spent serious time in the Evangelical Christian subculture. It's in the early experimental phase, but hopefully it can be an interesting place and perhaps a launching pad for some good research and commentary.
