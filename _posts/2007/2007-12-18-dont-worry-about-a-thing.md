Caught <em>I Am Legend</em> with Nate, and was definitely a lot more solid than I expected. Will Smith manages to pull off the last-man-on-earth cliche with appropriate bleakness, and when a couple of telegraphed moments finally arrive they still manage to punch. While it's not as deep as <em>Children of Men</em>, it's definitely in the same class: bleak, well-acted, and emotionally intense.
