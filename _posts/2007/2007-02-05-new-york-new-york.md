It's funny that <i>now</i> is when we have a meeting like this, but the project has been on track up to this point. The biggest problem is that the folks we're working with are facing 'catastrophic success' -- all the other business units in their company now want them to roll out sites that duplicate what we've done on a limited scale. And, of course, it has to be done yesterday...



So, between rounds of meetings we're enjoying good New York eatin' -- deli sandwiches the size of my head, amazing thin-crust pizza to die for, things like that. The Apple Store is an amazing temple of geekiness, too. Tomorrow I'm going to try to wander over and get some photos of it, maybe a Quicktime clip. Am I a geek? Yes. I am a geek.



When I get home, Catherine and I are totally going to go see <i>Children of men.</i> Awwww yeah.
