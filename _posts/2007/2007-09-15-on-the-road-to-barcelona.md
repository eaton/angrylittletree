So after a crazy week or two, the Lullabots and I are heading to the <a href="http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org">Barcelona Drupalcon.</a> We're looking forward to hanging out, geeking, and meeting up with the rest of the Drupal community. It's my first trip outside the country -- Catherine's bopped around Europe before but I'll be seeing things for the first time. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to play with the camera and I'll flickr my brains out. Woo!



With Drupal 6 entering beta now, momentum in the community is picking up even more. It'll be very interesting to see what new ideas and directions come out of the conference.



To those who've already arrived, see you in 15 hours!
