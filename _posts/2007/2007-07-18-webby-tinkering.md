I had some free time last night after work, and decided to finish up some design work I'd done on <a href="http://catherine.viapositiva.net">Catherine's blog.</a> Sh humors my occasional bursts of geekery on her 'home turf', with occasional 500 errors and muttered comments about testing new code. I'm pretty happy with the results, though -- a modified <a "http://www.oswd.org">OSWD design</a> and the addition of <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/websnapr">the WebSnapr</a> module gave the boost of New Spiffiness that it had been lacking.
