So the workshops are over and it's time to dive back into real life. I'll be relaxing with Catherine for the rest of the weekend, which will be great. I miss her and I miss home. Who wouldn't?



It's always great, though, to hang out with the rest of the Lullabots. I can honestly say that I <i>really enjoy</i> my job and I love the people I work with. Teaching and training with them, geeking out with them, and building cool things... it's a great way to make a living.
