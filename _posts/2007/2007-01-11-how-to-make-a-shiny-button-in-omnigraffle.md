One of my favorite new Mac apps is OmniGraffle, a slick piece of work that does diagramming, flowcharts, and other drawing oriented tasks. I needed a spiffy-looking logo button for a demo site this evening, and I needed something fast, so I popped open OmniGraffle and tried to whip something up. The results were pretty cool, so I thought it might be helpful to share the how-to:
