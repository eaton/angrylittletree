The FormAPI 3 presentation went better than I expected -- I was slotted in the main room, which I wasn't expecting at all, so there were odd moments of disorientation as I manned the "panel discussion table" solo. All turned out well, though, and I think the important bits got through. I'm tinkering around with a presentaiton-sharing site to post the slides; hopefully it will work.

Also? We found a <i>crepe bar</i>. The crepe artiste named Elmer made us awesome crepes with things like lime chocolate, and talked smack about George W. Bush. He's from Holland and -- in case this wasn't emphasized enough -- made really awesome crepes.
