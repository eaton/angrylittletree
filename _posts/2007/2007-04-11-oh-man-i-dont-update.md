I'm terrible about updating, aren't I? OSCMS went really well, though I came back with a lingering ugly cold/flu thing that's had me at 75% performance for a while. I finally feel like I've kicked it -- hooray!



This week I'm in Providence, RI again with the Lullabot crew, teaching a Drupal API workshop. It's been a blast so far, and the 20 or so people attending are really sharp. We've gone through a pile of core APIs, development best practices, FormAPI internals, security issues, and so on. Today we're going to be learning about hooking up with APIs like Views, CCK, Actions, and so on. Good times, good times!



I miss my Catherine, though -- she's back home writing and planning crazy garden plans and watching British mysteries, and I can't wait to get back. Yay!
