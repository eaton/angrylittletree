<p>And did I mention that I got a MacBook? In my rundown of 2006 events, I completely forgot to mention a momentous change in the flavor of my geekiness. After years in the Windows world, I returned to the fold and got myself a refurbed black MacBook.</p><p>It's been quite an experience -- I started making the PC transition in the days of MacOS 8, and the last I saw of it was MacOS 9. By that time I was working full time developing ASP sites and my PowerMac 7500 was beginning to gather dust. Goodness me, have things changed. These days, I do all my development work on Drupal, and OSX's rippingly cool UNIX underpinnings make that a breeze. I've got quick and easy shell scripts to set up local virtualhosts for patch testing, drag and drop icons to update CVS repositories, spiffy-looking icons that tell me when my cup of tea is done steeping...</p><p>It really is like coming home again.</p>
