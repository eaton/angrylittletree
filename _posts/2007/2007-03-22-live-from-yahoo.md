Blogging live from the <a href="http://2007.oscms-summit.org/">OSCMS Summit</a> in Sunnyvale, hosted by Yahoo. I arrived Monday night and it's been a nonstop parade of wacky with the rest of the Lullabots and all the other Drupal folks I'm finally getting a chance to meet up with. I met Dries, which was fun, followed by Karoly (the infamous chx!) last night, and a pile of other notable folks like sepeck, UnConeD, walkah, KarenS... I'll never catch all the names, but it's definitely cool.



Tuesday, the Bots and I drove into the mountains of California to visit Skywalker Ranch, the fortified compound of awesomeness built by George Lucas. It was gorgeous -- an awesome perk of working with Lullabot -- and I posted <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffeaton/tags/skywalker/">a hundred plus photos to flickr</a> from our tour; the folks there are doing really awesome stuff for education, and seeing them roll out a successful site with Drupal is loads of fun. Also, we kidnapped ewoks.

So I'm sitting in Rasmus' PHP performance and security talk now, surrounded by other geeks with their laptops out. It's fun, fun stuff and I'll be posting more stuff as it happens.



Viva la Drupal!
