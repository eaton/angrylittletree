With my 30th birthday coming up, and the schedule getting a little hectic, Catherine suggested that we have a night out to celebrate on the weekend. We got together with Jason and <a href="http://breezygirl.livejournal.com/">Steph</a>, had a yummy dinner, and caught a showing of Stardust.

I was pleasantly startled. The book was one of my favorites, a Gaiman story that nailed the sing-song rhythm of oldschool fairy tale, and the plot tied things together perfectly in a "happy ever after" twist. The film was faithful to the book and came together like a hip, 20th century <i>Princess Bride</i> with better pacing and better jokes. Big recommendation to anyone who's thinking about seeing it.



After the movie we hung out for a while, ate birthday cake, laughed, and talked. It came out in conversation that I have a box of random gummi things (moustaches, band-aids, pizzas, etc.) sent to me by the fine folks at <a href="http://www.predicate.org">Predicate</a> -- Jason immediately asked why I hadn't yet conducted the road tests of these products that were so clearly needed, and... well, before anyone really knew what was going on, we'd all bundled up off to the office and were documenting the discovery process with... Gummi Moustaches.

I don't think anything else really needs to be said. Catherine and Steph played Guitar Hero II while Jason and I did Wrong Things with Gummi, and a good time was had by all. Verdict? Huzzah! A great and relaxing weekend. But... yeah, gummi moustaches are vile.
