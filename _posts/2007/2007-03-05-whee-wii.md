This weekend has been a good one. I slacked -- which by my standards means debugging Drupal theme code and setting up a new site. The excitement from Friday's post about the Movable Type compatability theme for Drupal caught me off guard, and it's cool to see the reaction. (<a href="http://digg.com/software/Use_Movable_Type_styles_on_Drupal">My first digg</a>. Wheee!) I've ironed out some kinks in the 1.0 release, and it deals better with multicolumn scenerios. It also supports a neat MT-like 'Powered by Drupal' sidebar element. Normally I'd ditch that, but it became apparent that the lack of the 'moduled-powered' div was actually messing up a number of MT styles, so I slipped it back in.





<img src="/files/wiimote.jpg" align="right" hspace=10 vspace=10 />I've set up <a href="http://gutenberg.cookingwithdrupal.org">Gutenberg</a> as a demo site for a number of the cool styles that are out there. It's nothing special, just some demo content, but it's a nice example of how a simple Drupal site, with a couple of modules (Views for archives and Custom Pagers for the archive navigation headers) can take a huge bag full of 'stock' MT styles and look right spiffy. I've started emailing back and forth with Byrne Reese, one of the brains behind the excellent <a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com">Style Contest</a> web site that generated so many top-notch designs. He's hard at work planning improvement to the standard that could make it more platform agnostic and more flexible. It's exciting stuff -- folks who want to build a really customized system will always end up writing a theme from scratch (or creating their own templates, in Movable Type land), but these kinds of skinning systems are the bomb for blog sites that have similar content footprints.



In other news, it looks like Nintendo unplugged a drain somewhere: after months of hunting in vain for a second remote for the beloved Wii, I walked into target tonight and found <i>kajoodles</i> of them. There were even a couple racks of Classic controllers and Nunchuck remotes thrown in for good measure. Wow. I snagged a wiimote/nunchuck combo, so now Catherine and I can play two-person Elebits and indulge in matrimonial WiiBoxing whenever we want to. Let the good times roll!
