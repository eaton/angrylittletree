If you've spent any time in the Drupal community, you've run into the unstoppable Angela Byron -- a.k.a., Webchick. She's one of the pillars of the Drupal community: she writes documentation, helps train new users, organizes important projects, tests patches, writes modules, writes patches for Drupal Core, is a member of the Drupal Association board, and is basically <em>everywhere at once</em> and friendly while doing it.

Last night, while she helped organize a dinner for Drupal's founder Dries Buytaert, Webchick's car was broken into and her MacBook Pro was stolen. Like most of us geeks, Webchick's laptop is the hub of an entire digital life, and replacing it is no picnic. The good news, though, is that it gives us all a chance to do something cool for Webchick -- I've set up a Chipin.com fundraiser to replace Angie's laptop. Let's see if the Drupal community can take care of this little problem and get a brand new computer in her hands, eh? Eh! If you want to toss a few coppers in the can for Webchick, <a href="http://eaton.chipin.com/webchicks-stolen-laptop">click here!</a>

<strong>UPDATE!</strong> Hooooray! We raised just over $1500 for Angie, enough to pay for what her insurance company didn't cover, and some spiffy add-ons to make her computing experience even spiffier. She's now getting back into the swing of things and should be around soon! Thanks to everyone who donated and expressed their support. The Drupal community <em>rocks</em>.
