2006 was a pretty slow blogging year for me -- there were spikes as I churned out longish tech posts about Drupal, but beyond that the site was sadly neglected. With the arrival of my shiny new MacBook, though, I figured it was time to turn over a new leaf. I've installed <a href="http://www.larryborsato.com/bleezer/" text="Bleezer">Bleezer</a>, a relatively slick little cross-platform blogging client, and I've upgraded the site to Drupal 5 for general spiffiness purposes. If anyone out there knows of a better one for OSX, feel free to comment...



Hopefully, I'll be disciplined to churn out a few regular updates every week, perhaps even a couple per day. Back in the Livejournal days that was common; posting a single link or two, then firing off a few thoughts, etc. The difference between that kind of informal style and the more rigorous essay-esque blogging is interesting.
