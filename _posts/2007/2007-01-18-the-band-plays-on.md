The Lullabot workshops continue! On Tuesday, Angie and I finished up the teaching on Drupal Basics. We led a class full of 25 (relative) Drupal newbies through the process of building new content types with CCK, organizing them with custom views, and assembling them into various combinations of pages with the Panels module. There are other ways to do the same stuff in Drupal, naturally, but we explained that this was a way to do it <i>without</i> writing any custom code. Without exception, everyone was blown away by the rapid prototyping capabilities and the flexibility of Drupal's core system. It was a blast.



Today, while Ted and Nate teach the second half of the theming workshop, Angie and (perhaps!) Robert and I would like to kick back and get to rolling some of the initial patches to core that we'd like to see go in now that Drupal 5 is released and development on the next version has started.



And finally, I sorely miss Catherine. Thank goodness for cell phones. :-)
