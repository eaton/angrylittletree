I've been on the road for the last 10 days or so with the rest of the 'Bots, first for a training workshop in Providence and then for some on-site training with a client in NYC. It's the longest Catherine and I have been apart since we married, and it's been be back together after so long. It's startling how much those kinds of rhythms can become part of how you measure your days, and how off-kilter it can feel when they're disrupted.



The work itself was great, though -- the workshop was the largest we've ever done, with almost fifty people and a new venue to fit them all. Feedback has been great so far; there were a lot of great people there working on interesting projects. It's encouraging to see all of us (the Lullabot team, that is) polishing the flow and professionalism of the material. With each workshop, things are more refined, better focused, and so on. James did an awesome job organizing the week.



Spent the weekend in New York with James and Liza doing a bit of recuperating before diving into another two days of training with in-house developers for Mansueto. Their IncBizNet project soft-launched in beta a little over a month ago, and they're in the final stretch with the new Fast Company site. It's the culmination of over a year and a half of business development, planning, and then Drupal development.



And today? Back in the saddle with code reviews for Mansueto, outlining on the O'Reilly book, and other assorted projects. And this morning, my name popped up on the <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/speakers/">list of confirmed speakers</a> for the 2008 SXSW Interactive conference. I'll be participating in a panel discussion about open source web software organized by the head of <a href="http://www.palantir.net">Palantir</a>, a cool Chicagoland design/development company that's been doing great stuff with Drupal lately.



Whew.



Never a dull moment!
