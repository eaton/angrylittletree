Today's my first full day back home after a fabulous week in Barcelona with the Lullabot crew and other crazy Drupal-heads. It's going to be tough writing a good recap, because a lot of my excitement about the conference revolves around crossed paths and conversations, great ideas that were born and plans that were forged.

I'll be writing a lot more in the coming day or so about some proposals for Drupal 7, and how we can leverage the work in Drupal 6 effectively. But for now, I'm relaxing and getting over jetlag and reflecting on how much I enjoyed Barcelona, how much I am glad to be back home with my wife, and how awesome it is working with a team of people that I can honestly call my friends. It rocks.

One of the stand-out memories of the past week was a great dinner with Steven Wittens of Bryght, Allie Micka of Advantage Labs, and the dynamic duo of CCK development, Karen Stephenson and Yves Chedemois. Plan to meet up with a larger group of Drupal folks stumbled, and we ended up sharing awesome paella and sangria while talking about code, plans for the future, shared stories, and other fun. It was great to hang out and catch up with them as peers and just-plain-cool-people, under fireworks in the pleasant Mediterranean air.
