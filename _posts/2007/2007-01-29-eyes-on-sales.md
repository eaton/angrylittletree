Angela Byron, who I now work with a Lullabot, referred me to a guy building a web site for sales professionals. He was converting existing content from a homegrown CMS that had been running for a couple of years, and needed a Drupal guy to put things together.



Given the in-my-spare-time schedule and somewhat fuzzy scope, it dragged on for quite a while, but for a couple of month now it's been up and running successfully. While it's not as wild-and-crazy as MTV or The Onion, it led to a number of cool patches for the Views module (hello, custom arg handling!) as well as some enhancements to modules like Profile that may be rolled into future versions. In addition, it was the first time I put energy into using themed views for almost every listing page on the site.



I didn't design the theme -- a dedicated graphic designer put it together and I like it a lot. I just took the raw HTML template and adapted them into a Drupal theme with a support module to handle the tricky stuff. It turned out pretty well, all things considered, and I'm really happy with the results. If you're interested in checking it out, visit <a href="http://www.eyesonsales.com">Eyes On Sales.</a>
