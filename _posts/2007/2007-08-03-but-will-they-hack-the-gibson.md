PatientFox from #predicate pointed us to the script for <i><a href="http://www.xorph.com/clockers/clockers.html">Clockers</a></i>, a proposed steampunk remake of the cringe-inducingly dated <i>Hackers</i>. Is it wrong that I really, really want to see it now?



<blockquote><pre>          JUDGE



     Daedelus Murphy, I hereby fine you one thousand pounds sterling.



Gasps from the crowd.



     Should you be unable to summon sufficient funds, you or your

     surrogate will be sentenced to debtors' prison until such time

     as he has repaid it in full. In addition, you are prohibited from

     owning or operating a wrench, geartrain, pocketwatch or clock of

     any kind so long as you reside within this county.
