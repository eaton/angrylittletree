Catherine and I had a great Valentines' Day -- in addition to the usual romantic gestures I introduced her to <em>Raising Arizona,</em> which she'd never seen before. Pure magic: it's always gratifying to know that you married someone who finds classic Cohen brother insanity amusing, too.



And now, I'm on the road again. @quicksketch an I are heading out to Stanford to help train their internal team, and this week will be a parade of Drupaling. Sadly, I think @walkah will always win the frequent flyer mile contest.

The next couple of months promise to be packed, too; Drupalcon DC is coming up in just a couple of weeks, and I'll be presenting on <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/building-apis-rock">API design</a> and <a href="http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/promiscuous-drupal-building-your-site-web-apis">webservice-based site architecture</a>. Drupalcon's growth over the past few years has been crazy: this year, tickets sold out more than a month in advance. This fall, the European Drupalcon will be held in Paris -- hopefully the venue will accommodate will match the demand.



Looking a bit farther down the calendar, there's the SXSW CMS showdown: a team of Drupal devs and designers will be competing against Wordpress and Joomla! folks to build a reusable site for local nonprofits, and a team of judges will select a winner. After last year's warm SXSW welcome for Drupal, I'm hoping we can make the site shine. And later this spring, there's the <a href="http://www.cmsassociation.com/25.html">Chicago CMS Expo:</a> a combined Drupal/Alfresco/Joomla! event that I'll be speaking at. It's a great opportunity to connect with other projects in the OSS community, and I'm really looking forward to it. In addition to the usual presentations about Drupal development, I'll be speaking about successful GPL-based business models. There's a lot of interest in this in the Joomla! world especially, since they're going through a community discussion about how the GPL impacts for-profit extension development and template design.



Never a dull moment...
