When I say that I'm annoyed at people who are flat-out lying in public when important topics are discussed, I'm <em>not</em> talking about good-faith discussions on cost/benefit analysis or what not. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/08/08/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5226795.shtml">I'm talking about this kind of stuff, from Sarah Palin</a>:

<blockquote>The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.</blockquote>

It goes without saying that there are no 'death panels' being proposed. It's also worth noting that today, insurance companies declare Down Syndrome a pre-existing condition and can refuse to cover any medical expenses. <em>That's what the proposed health insurance bill is designed to stop.</em> That's right: Palin is claiming that a plan to preserve her child's access to health insurance is in fact a plan to <em>kill him.</em>



Mind you, that doesn't stop <a href="http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=333933006516877">The Investors Business Daily</a> <a href="http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/2009/08/10/it-doesnt-take-stephen-hawking-to-figure-this-one-out/">expanding on her warnings with another real-life example</a>.

<blockquote>People such as scientist Stephen Hawking wouldn't have a chance in the U.K., where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless.</blockquote>

<em><strong>Dear IBD Editors: Please note that Stephen Hawking was born, raised, and lives in the United Kingdom, and was covered at birth by the National Insurance Act of 1911.</strong></em>



The best part is that after spinning tales of "death committees" and calling the plan "evil," <a href="http://www.nbc26.com/global/story.asp?s=10878052">Palin posted on Facebook scolding people for not discussing health care civilly.</a> That, friends, is the death of debate.



<em>UPDATE: God, it just keeps getting worse. The IBD editorial that includes the Hawking comment also announces that the bill "compels seniors to submit to a counseling session every five years... about alternatives for end-of-life care." They even cite the pages -- 425-430. Unfortunately I have the bill and those pages do <strong>not</strong> compel any such consultations. They only <strong>extend coverage</strong> for them. Which is a bit like saying that Blue Cross is force-feeding opiates to the innocent because they cover Vicodin prescriptions.</em>
