So in a political matter unrelated to health care, former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee ruffled feathers this week by traveling to Israel and making barbed comments about Obama's policy towards Israeli settlements.



Much has been made of the fact that conservative bloggers ravaged Al Gore for doing the same thing a couple of years ago -- going to a foreign country and criticizing Bush's foreign policy. <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/08/17/huckabee/index.html">Glenn Greenwald in particular has harped on this</a>, and <a href="http://tigerhawk.blogspot.com/2009/08/in-which-i-agree-with-glenn-greenwald.html">one of the bloggers he pointed at has now come out condemning Huckabee for it</a>, as well.



On the one hand, it's an admirable display of consistency: if <em>criticizing the President's policies on foreign soil</em> is wrong, then it's wrong no matter who's in office.



On the other hand? I disagree.



I'll come back to just what I've been saying for the past decade or so: disagreeing with the President is <em>perfectly fine.</em> Doing so publicly, in another country, even an enemy country, in front of people who also disagree with the president? Perfectly fine. Mind you, I'm steadfastly opposed to <em>lying</em> -- saying that the President plans to bomb Brazil, or something like that, is irresponsible in the same way that any public lie about important policy matters is irresponsible and unacceptable. But <em>disagreement?</em> We're a democracy (democratic republic, for the score-keepers in the audience): we're supposed to be able to handle this kind of thing.



If a crazy communist gets elected to Congress (my money's on Minnesota for sheer unpredictability), and they want to tool around the world talking about how America is full of imperialists, okay. Fine. If a hardcore libertarian wants to rally the troops and give speeches in China about how US trade protection should be abolished, <em>okay.</em> If the people they represent continue to elect them, so be it!



Really, who cares? <em>We're big boys and girls.</em> The president is expected to be an adult with a slightly thicker skin than your average livejournal member. The President is an elected leader, not the father of a dysfunctional family. "Maintaining a united front" is unnecessary on these kinds of policy matters, because <em>we pass laws</em> when stuff really matters.
