Started playing The Darkness for the XBox 360; it's an interesting game with a lot of curious cinematic narrative segments between action sequences. Confessional main-character-talks-to-you type of stuff.



In level one, I was possessed by an unholy creature of darkness, and manifested its power to devour the still-beating hearts of the mafia hitmen who'd come to kill me. Then I shot out all the streetlights so I could hide in darkness, where my power grows.



In the second level, my girlfriend fell asleep on the couch watching TV. I can't figure out how to stand up while she's leaning on me, though. So I'm sitting here, blogging, while the in-game television cycles through old black and white movies.

After a few minutes, it said that I'd unlocked the "Romantic" achievement. So far, the game feels very... <em>uneven.</em>
