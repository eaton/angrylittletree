So the hot news (or at least warm news) is that the <a href="http://www.phillymag.com/articles/philadelphia_inquirer_1978_called_it_wants_its_newspaper_back/?hpv">Philadelphia Enquirer is filing for bankruptcy</a>. I crossed paths with them a little over a decade ago, editing an article about their move to an internal SGML based production workflow. It's not much of a connection, but after that I always remembered the paper and it occupied an "interesting and noteworthy" slot in my memory.

In the MetaFilter thread on the paper's troubles, dw made some <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/79416/Philadelphia-Inquirer-and-Daily-News-file-for-Bankruptcy#2463748">interesting observations about the industry-wide problems in a digital age</a>:



<blockquote>Micropayments won't work -- they're too cost intensive. The "iTunes for news" idea won't work -- news is something you consume and throw out, not buy and collect and read again and again like a book. Paywalls have had very mixed results and tend to create walled gardens of information separate from the general news world. And charging for news online, no matter the route, always runs smack into the idea of economic substitution.</blockquote>



dw is right (in my opinion, at least) that there is no simple solution to the stresses of the Newspaper industry. In my opinion, the one big point in favor of institutional news organizations is their ability to hire and support quality journalists working on news coverage of important issues. Sometimes they don't deliver on that promise, but I think it's fair to say that the blogging world (for all its army-of-Davids passion) has produced only a tiny fraction of the original investigative journalism of just one major national paper.



Is there any way to make that aspect of the industry sustainable? @adders and @substitute might have the best insights, I suspect. Me? I'm just a guy sitting on the sidelines with a lot of opinionated rants. How very <em>bloggy</em> of me.
