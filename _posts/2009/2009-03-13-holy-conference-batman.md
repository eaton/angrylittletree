Let me tell you what.



I had some <em>mighty</em> big plans to write about web trends, and SXSW, and DrupalCon, and all kinds of amazing stuff exactly <em>one week ago.</em> That is, of course, a bit before #drupalflu turned into a trending topic on Twitter.com. Today, having weathered the storm, I am a new man. Freshly shaved, freshly showered, and able to eat food again.



'Con updates will be posted shortly, along with photos and session recaps. Sadly, I won''t be able to join @walkah, @lizak, @jjeff, @mettamatt, and the Palantir gang in Austin for South by Southwest this year. It's killing me to miss all the awesome, but the better part of valor, and all that.



Instead, I will pontificate!



<em>Fear it.</em>
