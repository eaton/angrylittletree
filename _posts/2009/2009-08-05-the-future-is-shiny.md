My slow but steady transformation from .Net enterprise middleware developer to webby Apple hipster is finally complete: after much hemming and hawing, Catherine and I finally took the plunge and got us some iPhone.



We both knew that my cave-in was inevitable; the rest of the @lullabot crew has been migrating to the iPhone since the day it was released, and my technofetishism makes it nearly impossible to resist any device that offered to put Google Earth in my pocket. What I wasn't expecting was how smoothly it would integrate with most of the other services I'm already using. Google Reader, Evernote, Tumblr, Urbanspoon, Tripit, etc... When you put those kinds of services into a pocket-sized device, make it easy to enter and manipulate data (goodbye, T-9 text completion), and assume that ubiquitous positioning data via GPS and cell tower triangulation is a basic OS-level service, things just <em>happen.</em> I went to pick up @mettamatt for a client meeting, and ran into traffic -- Google Maps told me that the jam was only a mile or so deep, and I dind't have to worry about missing the meeting. I'd forgotten to write down the hotel Matt was staying in -- but he'd shared his itinerary with me, so the TripIt application already had his arrival times, hotel info, and a convenient one-click map from <em>where I was parked</em> to the place he was staying.



The games are fun, streaming from Last.FM while I'm in the car is silly but enjoyable, and all the Apple UI polish is definitely nice. But the critical mass of location and social-graph aware web apps that have iPhone apps to simplify access? <em>That</em> is what impresses me. The future's here. Now I just need to figure out how to play AVI files on it...
