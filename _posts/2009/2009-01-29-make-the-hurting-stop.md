Thanks to the magic of Netflix On Demand, @squorch and I took an evening to sync up our computers and watch <em>Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed.</em> I will attempt to summarize the film's message:

Darwinists hate Intelligent Design because they hate Christians. This means that Christians make the best scientists, but science makes people atheists, so scientists are atheists, which is why Christians hide the fact that they're not atheists when doing science, except for the liberal Christians, who are Hitler and hate Jewish babies. This is how we know Intelligent Design has nothing to do with religion.

Ronald Reagan loved Freedom.
