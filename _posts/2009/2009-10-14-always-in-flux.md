It's been almost six months since I promised/threatened/vowed to convert my blog to Wordpress -- in the meantime I've become even more dependent on the easy-to-update transience of services like <a href="http://twitter.com/eaton">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://eaton.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/198971">GoodReads</a> and so on. Every time I consider rolling my own or spending the time to actually <em>migrate</em> my daily flow to another system, one of those webby services makes it just a bit easier to stick with them. <a href="http://delicious.com/positivejeff">Delicious,</a> for example, bumped up the limit on their "description" field to a full 1K of text a few months ago. Voila - Delicious.com as a link review site, with enough space for lengthy commentary.



And Tumblr is tempting as a place for ambient pastable stuff and thoughts that are too long for Twitter. Still, it's brutally difficult to really get an aggregation system going that pulls all of the disparate bits together <em>and</em> gives me the control to wrap it in my own site identity, additional archives, and so on. No matter what system I use -- Drupal, Wordpress, Django, etc. -- there's just a pile of work standing between my dream "engine" and current reality.



In the meantime? More tweaking, more futzing, and more sad sighs at my atrophied design muscles. The deeper you get into one system, you more you want to branch out to others -- and the more frustrating it is when you actually do, only to discover that mastering them will take just as long as it did with the first one. Alas!
