After all the reminiscing that @emmajanedotnet and I were doing about typography the other day, I decided to hunt down an old novelty font I'd put together based on simple ballpoint pen block lettering. There's nothing particularly special about the font (I called it <em>Verby Blocks</em>) but some poking and prodding in <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net">FontForge</a> ironed out some of the kinks. Why not post it for downloading?
