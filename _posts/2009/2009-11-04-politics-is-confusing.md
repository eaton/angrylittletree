From the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/11/04/election.analysis/index.html">CNN article on the 2009 mid-terms:</a>

<blockquote>Hoffman's loss certainly doesn't help these conservatives, but it is not a fatal blow, either. The battle for these activists was with the GOP leadership, and they won by successfully pushing GOP nominee Dede Scozzafava out of the race.</blockquote>

As I understand it, national conservative activists decided that a local Republican candidate was not conservative enough, recruited their own non-local candidate who entered the race, and attacked the local Republican candidate.



The Republican candidate recognized that her base was split down the middle, and withdrew from the race -- <em>then endorsed the Democratic candidate.</em> The Democratic candidate won.



I get the idea that this is an ideological victory, but what they did is not actually that difficult: <em>they torpedoed a candidate by splitting her voting block.</em> I guess that's what purges and in-group battles for control are all about, but hey. Am I missing something here?
