I caught a brief twitter message by @codinghorror mentioning the new <a href="http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=52443">GI Joe movie</a> that will be promoted during the superbowl. Fabulous, I'm saying in my head as I click through. Another mediocre adaptation of an 80s cartoon given the big Hollywood treatment. Isn't what they did to Bumblebee enough? if only they would--

I... yeah, sorry, I can't remember what I was saying anymore. My inner 11 year old is at the controls right now, and he just keeps saying, "OH MY GOD DID YOU SEE THAT SNAKE EYES TOTALLY JUMPED OUT OF A PLANE WITH A SWORD AND FLIPPED A CAR OVER AND FOUGHT STORMSHADOW, THAT WAS RADICAL!"
