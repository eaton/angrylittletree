I have an on-again-off-again relationship with computer and console gaming. I'll tinker casually with flash games and putter around with diversionary stuff, and occasionally I dive in when some really, really good stuff hits the street, but I don't sit around anticipating The Next Season's New Releases or anything like that.



I used to keep my PC all juiced up and optimized for gaming, but when I stared doing more LAMP stack web work and moved to the Mac, I started falling behind the times. Unless you are <em>really, really hardcore</em> it's hard justify keeping up with the hardware arms race that defines PC gaming. These days I can hardly <em>launch</em> most release titles on the PC, and I've given up.



Last Christmas, though, @sparrowpost dropped an XBox 360 in my lap and a lot changed. First, it was a ticket for the Fallout 3 Train, a fantastic vehicle that I'd actively lusted after for <em>a decade.</em> Literally. A decade. I <em>extracted</em> fun from that game and all of its expansion packs like a juice machine. Other games followed, and the surprise bonus of XBox Live Arcade made it even sweeter. I started using the XBox as our media center -- streaming video off the file server and playing Netflix movies, and... well, basically it's pretty indispensable now.



The end result, of course, is that now I <em>know</em> about all of these cool new games, and some of them look really <em>interesting</em> and... suddenly somehow I've turned into the guy who compares his friend's scores and obsesses about the quality of the "action" on a Rock Band guitar controller.



Two of the most recent additions to the gaming rotation are <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em> and <em>Borderlands.</em> Both are pretty action-oriented, and Borderlands is even first-person, a genre I said I would never learn to enjoy on the console. I lied: Fallout 3 gave me VATS training wheels, and now as I play Borderlands the run-and-gun mechanics feel pretty natural.

Batman: Arkham Asylum's high point is definitely its on-the-money Dark Knight vibe. You're retaking Arkham from an army of Joker-led escapees, and you have to do lots of skulking, dropping from the shadows, and old-fashioned fist-fighting to make it happen. Once I unlocked a few of the Challenge Modes, where you can brawl with an entire crowd of thugs or time yourself taking out armed guards in a challenging locale, I forgot to finish the game. There's just something beautiful -- ballet-like -- about the process of taking down six machine-gun-toting criminals with a smoothly choreographed combination of kicks, jumps, cape-whips, and thrown punches.

Borderlands, on the other hand, feels like what you'd get if you mashed up Fallout 3 with <em>The Mexican</em>. It's a strait-up action RPG with lots of level grinding and milkrun missions for NPCs, and on paper looks like it could get old fast. It's saved by good mechanics, nearly infinite list of equipment (something like 1.6 trillion discrete kinds of gear?), and a tight sense of style. Watch the opening cinematic, and ask yourself if it feels, you know... <em>awesome.</em> If the answer is yes, get the game. Because the <em>whole game feels like that.</em> Apparently, there are all kinds of multiplayer options. Eventually, I'll care -- for now, I'm too busy level grinding and trying to figure out the best combination of anti-armor sniping rifle and close-support SMG will be for my incursion into the old city...
