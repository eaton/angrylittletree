While the post stayed up (and the contest stayed open) a bit longer than I'd intended due to busy schedules, but today I took some time and read through the awesome comments.

There are some <em>really</em> cool people out there doing interesting things with Drupal, and planning really exciting projects. Helping foster families connect with kids? Building collaborative tools for green communities? Connecting amateur robot builders? All very, very awesome. Figuring out who to send off a copy of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596515804/viaposit-20">Using Drupal</a></em> to was tough.

At the end of the day, one project really jumped out. Webmaster Ari Davidow has been maintaining <a href="http://www.klezmershack.com">KlezmerShack</a> since the 1990s. It's a site about Klezmer, a traditionally Jewish form of music that spent a couple of centuries under the radar, and experienced a revival in the 1970s. (I'm no expert, but I think his dedication shows: the site was second only to Wikipedia when I googled for "Klezmer".) According to Ari:

<blockquote>[The site] contains reviews, band listings, an international calendar, a blog, articles, vendor listings--it is one of the most immaculately messy collections of hand-crafted obsolete HTML (with some help along the way from Movable Type, bless it).

it's time to move the site into the 21st century. Bands should be able to maintain their own listings. People should be able to rate bands. People should be able to get the word out without my mediation.</blockquote>

That's one of the reasons the site excites me -- this is the kind of stuff that Drupal really excels at, and the kind of stuff we wanted to help people accomplish by writing <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596515804/viaposit-20">Using Drupal</a>.</em> I think the site is a really good match for it, and I hope Ari digs his new copy of the book.

My only regret is that I can't drag an entire armload of the books out to the post office and send them off to everyone who posted about their "dream site." If any of you have updates or news about how the sites are progressing, I'd love to hear about them as they grow!
