This one's a little tricky: beacuse GitHub pages doesn't include any provisions for .htaccess or meaningful redirects, I'm cobbling together meta refresh based redirects. Because it's a huge pain in the ass (by my standards), I'm just generating a folder full of cloned posts that use the "redirect" layout, and nuking the actual contents.

Trying not to pine for a decent CMS here, and failing.
