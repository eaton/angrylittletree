zounds. somewhere along the line, when i wasn't paying attention, i got a social life. I think it might've come with my job, like the box of jelly beans they gave me when i started, but can't be sure.

After a day of work (moved offices, have a window, have working air conditioning. Aw yeah!) on Friday, I bombed over to Greg Heath's apartment for a gaming party in the city. He and Jeff R. have a great pad, good rent and a central location by the blue line. And a big screen TV with a playstation 2. That's the really cool part. We all thrashed around in Gran Turismo 3 for a while... Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast... then Scott and I played Double Dragon (!!!!!) on the old NES. Oh, the flashbacks! Oh, the famliar gesture of pull-out-cartridge-blow hard-on-connectors-pop-back-in-and-reset!

Spy Hunter and Hogan's Alley were favorites too. Mike K and I went gangsta-style with the light gun and made a ne wrule that you had to trash-talk the cutouts as they popped up on the screen to be shot. It's hard to be serious when you're playing an 8-bit classic.

After a few hours of fun, I drove back to the burbs and met up with Trin, Jason, and Justin... we played a couple other games for a while, had donuts and coffee, talked, and generally chilled until three in the morning or so. It was good, nothing really major but we got to spend some time catching up.

Final note: Trin cheats at Tekken 3. ;-)
