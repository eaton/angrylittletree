[GEEK] Well, I've decided that I lurve the XML DOM and all the toys that come with it. I now want to make the world run on XML. Unfortunately, the learning curve is a little steep and I'm banging my head trying to create XML trees using the DOM instead of constructing them by hand. Bah. Bah! [/GEEK]

Ahem. Sorry about that...  Going to see Coldplay with Trin and Siri and Fur tonight, which should be fun. Hopefully we'll get a chance to watch the muppet movie, as I now own it on DVD. Yummy DVD. Yay muppets!
