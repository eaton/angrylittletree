i'm angry, at no one but myself. why can't I leave well enough alone? the concert was good -- he atmosphere more than the music itself, as i've never heard coldplay before and it's hard to get into the groove of things if you're hearing it fresh at a live show. a phone-argument while driving to the aragon, and the hellish traffic (2.5 hours for a trip that's normally 45 minutes) didn't help my mood, either... ran into woz and jeff b. from work there, which was pretty fun. introduced them to trin and siri and fur. afterwards, retired to the jess n' siri pad, chilled for a while, grabbed some snackish items from dominicks with siri and fur, then came back and popped in the muppet movie DVD. halfway through, everyone was asleep and i was almost dead myself... i headed home and crashed. c'est la vie...
