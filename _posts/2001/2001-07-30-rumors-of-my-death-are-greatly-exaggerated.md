everything that happens to us is perceived as narrative, i think. we can't make sense of something until it's pieced into the context of our own evolving story, the plot that we're living out each day. even the unexpected shocks and surprises factor in -- they're plot twists, a necessary part of any good dramatic work.

without that structure? nothing makes sense. the post structuralists were right about that, at least. sometimes, though, you have to take a break from the narrative. an interlude. something like that.

consider my life boring for now -- chaos will resume at a later date.
