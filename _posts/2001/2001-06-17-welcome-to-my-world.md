A very interesting weekend, all things considered. Melodrama, adventure, suspense, tragedy, triumph, shopping, and polyester.

We all congregated to Jess and Siri's place Friday night, naturally, and rather than watching the Matrix on the IMAX screen, Trin and Danny and I ended up chilling on the deck and talking about old stories and memories and thoughts and dreams (and the infamous Louis!) until about one in the morning. Brett lost consciousness and Siri was scampering about working on an oil painting when Jason called my cell -- he was near a shell station in Downtown Chicago, and could we pick him up? Sure, I said. Gimmie the address. He did, I hung up, and we hit the road. GPS'd our way there and found him, after a bit of wandering once we found the general area, then drove back to the apartment and chilled, laughed, talked, then collapsed and slept. It was three in the morning.

The next day, when we managed to drag ourselves from the couches and futons and assorted piles of blankets, Trin and Jason and I went out to hit ragstocks and I actually got some new clothes. tremble. fear. shudder. Startlingly enough... the whole thing worked well and I even nabbed a belt and a new pair of cheap shoes that went with it. perhaps soon, i will dare to have my hair cut differently. shock!
