bookstores are a re-centering experience for me... i can't explain it, but being in the presence of huge quantities of printed matter is something that soothes me. the experiences, the thoughts, the hurts, the joys, the stories, the insights, the inane blather... all of it poured into ink and scratched onto paper. No matter how low things are, it helps. Just walking through a bookstore, fingers sliding over the spines, not even bothering to focus on the titles. it's not the books themselves, or even the words.

i think it just feels like home, more than any other place can. the knowledge that the books are what they are gives me some peace.

i wish i could explain it better than that.
