<A href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/things/37f3.html"><img src="http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/lg-opencola.jpg" align="right" border="0"></a>boo-yah! i ventured into the smoky abyss of The City tonight to drop off S's birthday present (I'd been waiting ages to give it. I'm horrendous at waiting to give presents to anyone, and I'm pretty proud of myself for holding out.).

the real news though is that J & D nabbed me a kickass birthday present: <a href="http://www.opencola.com/">Open Source Cola.</a> It's soda with a GPL recipe, and instructions on the can written in PERL! It's a geek fantasy come true. Cola, by geeks for geeks...

I feel all warm and fuzzy and tingly now...
