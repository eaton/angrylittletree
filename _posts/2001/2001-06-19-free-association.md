It's amazing what you lose when you force yourself to stop hoping. It's not what you expect -- it never is. The hurt doesn't go away like you'd thought it would. It stays, like some fruit left in the sun, shrunken but still present. The only thing that leaves is the joy. Those moments of clear cold-water-in-the-sun pleasure are gone, replaced by the smirk and the malignant cynicism. It's worth it, though. Because if you keep hoping, it keeps hurting more and more each time. So you fight it back, and you smirk, and you wear those shades, and you walk into the sunset. Because the only thing that matters is that you're not holding the bag.
