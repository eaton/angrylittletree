Words fail. Utterly and completely. I've seen Mike Knott live, and heard his solor accoustic version of The Healing. I stood front row for The Choir's 2001 Cornerstone show. They played About Love, Circle Slide, and A Sentimental Song. They were tight, and the crowd sang along with every song and it was one of those long eternal moments that makes everything you endure during the fest worth it, and even beautiful and perfect because without it, seeing a show like that would've been too *easy*...

Wow.

When the set was finally over and the last couple chords of Circle Slide faded out, they all piled offstage and the applause was deafening. Then it didn't stop. And eventually they jogged up onto the stage again and encored with Chase The Kangaoo.

It's interesting that my first real road trip journal was written to Circle Slide; the memories associated with each track of that disk are thickly layered, bronzed in nostalgia and emotional conections. Seeing Gary, Steve, and the rest of the band play the songs for the Cstone Crowd, it was easy to think the band was sentimental, too...
