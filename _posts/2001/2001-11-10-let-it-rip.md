Woo woo! Freelance work proceeding as planned, job hunting proceeding as well as can be expected. Grabbed the <A HREF="http://www.shrek.com/">Shrek DVD</A> this week, and watched it for the first time. Without a doubt, it's one of the best CGI films I've ever seen. <A HREF="http://www.finalfantasy.com/">Final Fantasy</A> was pretty, but it didn't have plot worth squat. Shrek is so chock full of zany pop culture references, classic fairy tail skewering, and great delivery that I couldn't help but love it.

In other news, I finally worked on more updates to the <A HREF="http://www.havana-mod.com">Havana Mod</A> site. More provisions for news articles, a more streamlined set of backend code, and (wahoo!) more fiction has been uploaded.

In even cooler news, the <A HREF="http://www.icab.de">iCab</A> validates the site as HTML 4.01 compliant! I realize that I'm a geek for getting excited about this, but hey. I'm allowed. The <A HREF="http://www.icab.de">WC3 Validator</A> still found a couple of issues, but it's mostly minor stuff I can take care of with a couple tweaks to the include files. Yay.

Friday night, i bopped to Gameworks with some old friends from <A HREF="http://www.geneer.com">my previous job</A>. Lou and I somehow managed to crash the air hockey machine. We R |33+.
