So it's time to grit my teeth again and put a bullet into the crush that's blossomed over the last couple of months and weeks. For a long time -- years -- it got easier each time. I learned the routine, I learned how to deal with it, and I fell back on all the assumptions that had served me well for a decade. For some reason it's not so easy anymore. I'd be in great shape regarding relationships -- at peace with the lack of one -- if it weren't for this 'hope' thing. Every time I manage to hit that zen 'elimination of desire' thing, some well-meaning friend wanders by and gushes on about how I'll make someone deliriously happy, and I'm sure to meet The Girl Of My Dreams(tm) in days, if not minutes!
 
I'd be fine if it weren't for this damned *hope* business.
 
I just want to be content.
 
Is that too much to ask?
 
Yeah. I thought so.
 
A friend gave me the psychic bitch-slapping I needed, when i asked for advice regarding the aforementioned crush. She was right, and I'm always thankful to hear the truth about what people think would be a bad idea. It still sucks though.
 
It's so easy to channel disappointment and hurt into rage, aggression, even creative energy if it's harnessed right. But it hurts so bad once you let it get rolling. Like those cartoons of a snowball tossed down a hill in winter -- by the time it stops at the bottom, it's the size of a house. That's what the disappointment feels like, and I'm trying not to dwell on it.
 
So here I am again, still not over a relationship that ended pushing a year ago. Fighting a growing crush on someone I would rather not weird out by expressing interest to. Wishing that things were simpler. Wishing I could have a do-over on the last two years of my life. Welcome to humanity. 
--the verb.
