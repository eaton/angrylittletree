I learned a long long time ago that I can be a very, very, very hurtful person. the flip side to empathy and a gift for words is the ability to shred people without so much as a blink. forget insults, forget sarcasm. just lay them bare and jab at their own private little fears and insecurities and leave them on their backs. sometimes when i'm angry at someone it takes a lot of really conscious effort to hold back. the only downside is that it's harder to hold back when i'm angry at myself.

funny how that works, isn't it?
