in writing this, i fear that those who read it will misunderstand my words or, at the very least, think less of me for writing them. i do not look outward for approval or confirmation, but the thought that my words will fall flat and hollow as they are read... that thought pains me.

it has been nine months since i have held another in my arms, and i miss that more than anything. i realize that this is unfair to say; unfair to words and thoughts and prayers and kisses and laughter and a host of touches, tender and otherwise.

but on nights like these, i ache for the simple act of holding and being held.

a movie, a song, a book. my arms around her waist, her head on my chest as we watch, listen, read. eyes closed, warm breath on her scalp the rise and fall of my chest against her back. hours can pass that way, and it would never be too much. would never be enough.

it is here that i pause.

i will say it as plainly as i can -- i am not writing about sex. or arousal. or the breathy thrill of a stolen kiss or a slow caress. even after a short few days i knew that those are far easier to find than what i miss.

i miss the intimacy.

i miss knowing her --
knowing anyone --
that way.

with her, i rediscovered my need for touch. for closeness. now it frightens me. i do not believe that it is wrong -- there should be no confusion. but fear it? of course i do.

my words are not a request. not a plea for pity, nor a subtle proposition. i write because i need the words to give shape to senses, longings, memories. i write because i think the words will set me free. i write because i never want to <b>want</b> again.
