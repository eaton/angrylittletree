Oh dear Lord, Soviet is sweet. The curse of christian synthpop with crappy vocals has been broken, by three guys from new york and their kickin' sweet cd.

Danny, Anna, Jess, and  Tessa all piled in for the trip to the dorms, and afterwards we hit Walmart. Mmm... Walmart. 30 seconds after entering the store we forgot what we came for and bounced around from rack to rack like product-starved ferrets. After days i nthe heat and the mud and the dark and the cold, it felt like a luxury to, say, buy a jumbo jar of pickles and a box of goldfish crackers without hiking a mile and a half through crowds and golf-carts. But there were still lots of emo kids, and some militant kanadianstried to ram us with their cart.
