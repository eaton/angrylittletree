ups and downs and some sideways, too. what do you do when the world splits in two? i don't know. it's been... an interesting day or so. to say the least.

friends hurting friends, picking up the pieces. trying to learn what love looks like without the lacey trim and the red hearts. I'm being vague, and I don't think it's intentional. It just all sucks, pretty much.
