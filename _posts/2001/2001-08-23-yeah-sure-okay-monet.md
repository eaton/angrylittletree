so i've vanished off the face of the earth, as far as livejournal is concerned... i know, i know. i should be ashamed of myself. the last week (or two or three) has just felt really draining for some reason. i think i'm finally starting to feel some of the emotional impact of a lot of recent events in my circle of friends and, to a lesser extent, my work.

good things have happened, though. among other things, <a href="http://www.planet-unreal.com/infiltration">INF 2.8.6</a> is almost out. Woo!
