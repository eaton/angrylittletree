<IMG SRC="http://claire.sprintpcs.com/claire/images/clairesm.gif" BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT">So I call Sprint customer service to ask about different rate plans, since my year-old plan is actually one of the LEAST economic ones now that the price wars are in full swing. I fully expect to get to the touchtone menu, hit 2, and go on with my life. But no... there's something else in store for me today.

Claire.

What crack-addled marketing person, what usability neophyte, decided that it would be a good idea to replace (a) the precision of a touch tone menu, and (b) the intelligence of a real person... with an automated voice recognition system that pretends to be a person?

"Speak the option you'd like to hear more about."  *long pause*  "Here are some examples.... Service Plans! Or billing questions..." and so on and so forth. More time is spent waiting for Claire to explain that, yes, she really does want to help you out, than could be wasted by even the worst touchtone menu.

Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Jakob, where are you?
