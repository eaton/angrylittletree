Well... back to the grind at work. It could be worse, really -- after Cornerstone I've come back reinvigorated and ready to rock, despite the physical exhaustion. Coding is a joy again. Yay! The project I worked quintuple time on before leaving is coming together, thanks to 12 hour days by my coworkers while I was gone... eek!

Unfortunately, our Business Analyst was driving to Indiana to demo the app to the client and his car's gas tank, steering column, and a few other critical bits were shredded by some metal debris on the road. When we last heard from him, he was stranded in Gary Indiana and the fire department was foaming down his car. Dear Lord.

We need to get him some beer when he gets back.
