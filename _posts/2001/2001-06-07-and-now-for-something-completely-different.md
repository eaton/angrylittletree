There are two dangers in keeping a net.journal. One, assuming that anyone actually cares or reads what you're writing. Nothing builds narcissism like that 'Wow! The world is watching me!' feeling. Then you veer into traditional web journal egotism, thinking that North America will cease to exist if you don't tell the world that your fridge light burnt out this afternoon.

Of course, the *other* danger is assuming that nobody cares and nobody reads it. And then you just post stuff for the heck of it, and you let yourself get lazy and make references to those desperate crushes you're nursing on that good friend, and then *bam* -- your in box is piling up with What-The-Heck messages from everyone you know.

It's nasty stuff.
