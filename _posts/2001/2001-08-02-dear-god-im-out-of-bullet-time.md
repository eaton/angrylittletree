I've finished Max Payne, the coolest damn action game ever crafted by human hands. Words fail -- it was a quick play, but oh MY what a ride it was. A pulpy film noirish vibe with a Die Hard plot and The Matrix's special effects. Dive into a bar full of mafia thugs in this game, and everything snaps to slow motion, the deep thuds of each bullet firing reverbrating off your walls from those speakers you had the foresight to hook up to the sound card. Bottles of vodka explode in glass and liquid, chunks of wood paneling fly as they unload shotguns in your direction, and there you are, diving for the floor with dual ingram automatics blazing, every shell casing arcing through the air like a dream, aiming in perfect action movie hero style, sliding into the wall and snapping back into realtime as the last of the gunmen falls. You're on the trail of your wife's killer, and no mafia don is going to stop you.

Violent? Heck yeah. Cinematic? <b>HECK YEAH.</b> It's every John Woo movie rolled into one, with an immersive textured environment that avoids stupid jumping puzzles and keycard searches. And when you're stuck in an elevator with cheesy music? You can shoot out the speaker.

Max Payne is the bomb. Now, to start hacking the engine and making cool mods...
