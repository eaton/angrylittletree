o/~ everything grey was silver, everyone wise was blind.. o/~

got the choir's speckled bird CD playing while I slog through oracle SQL queries. brings back so many incredible flashbacks to the live show at cornerstone. circle slide, for whatever reasons, is still imbedded in my psyche, one of those cds that becomes fixed in your memory, associated with a series of memories and experiences that you'll never be able to forget. smells, sights, feelings, an entire perceptual environment comes back to me immediately when I hear the first chords of 'About Love'...

i love that song.
