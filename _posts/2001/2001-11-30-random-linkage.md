http://www.hilaryhahn.com -- the 3-year travelogue of a 22 year old concert violinist. Articulate and insightful, and it has excellent music as the background.

I just stumbled across this, and spent an hour or so poring over it. I'm not sure whether to get a crush on her for being a 22 year old concert violinist who's well-read and articulate, or despise her for being able to have the sony publicity and marketing department design and maintain her livejournal. hmmmmm.
