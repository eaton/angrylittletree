So here it is at three in the morning in the middle of rural illinois and I'm in my tent, listening to rivulets and violets for the first time in one year, seven months and twenty-some odd days. I haven't heard it since I sent M. my copy for Christmas in '99, and it's soooo good to hear it again. Some music has an incredible calming effect, like a favorite book, or herbal tea, or a long long walk alone after a day when nothing went right.

New Jersey.

I went over to visit Jess and Danny at the Decapolis booth in the merch tent, and Jeff Benson ended up tapping me on the shoulder. Hoi! He'd arrived a few hours earlier and was killing time before the Poor Old Lu show (my first guess had been right). Turns out he's sleeping in his car this year, as other accomodations fell through. I wonder if we can get him a nicer place to crash. Then again, if it rains there isn't must to improve on with a car. It's sealed, off the surface of the ground, and can heat you up or cool you off as needed.

Hmmm... why am I in my tent again? ;-)

Made it to the Poor Old Lu show and I enjoyed myself a lot -- they have a new CD coming out this fall, and the hardcore fanbase exploded at the announcement. I never listened to Poor Old Lu 'back in the day' but now that I hear them on and off, I actually like them. I'm glad I caught the live show, I may try to see their second show when the fest gets officially started.

Fur and I saw Beck sing harmony for a Lutikris song, which was definitely an experience. ;-) Lutikriss is one of those groups that believes it's not *really* a concert unless the lead singer dives to the floor of the stage repeatedly while singing, like someone trying to fly HHGttG style. Much thrashing, much screaming, much distortion. And then Our Little Beck got up there and tore into the crowd with that great voice. Awwwww. We're all planning on seeing her official group play on Saturday.

Hung out at Decap afterwards, delivering a sewing kit to help patch Danny's torn jeans and a disinfectant pack for CJess's damaged piercing. The Trouble Bag saves the day again!

Ended up didtching the Joy Electric show at 11:30, since they'll be playing again and their first-shows are usually a little weak. When they play Friday night, the crowd will already be pumped for dance music and won't need to be hyped. ;-)

So we hung around the Celestial Static tent, teased their drummer Erin, and had a general good time. She's a cutie, and they're raffling off a date with her to anyone who signs up for their mailing list. Bwah hah.

Fur ended up going back to the tents to help some guy find a Java Bar set up near our site, and when she took a while we radio'd back to see what was up. It didn't seem to be fur on the other end though, so we played 20 questions.

"Are you a vegetable?"
"*static*"
"Are you broccoli?"
"I'm not a vegetable!"
"Oh. Are you taller than six inches?"
"Yes. Unless you put me in the oven."
"How many limbs do you have?"
"Fifteen."
"Are you Brett?"

And so on and so forth. As it turns out, it was Siri, arrived a day early to take advantage of the fourth with us. Awwwww. She even brough me a nifty present from Sun Cuty -- a T-shirt with step by step instructions on how to jump from a moving car printed on it in pictoral form. Either she knows me very well, or she's trying to kill me. Hmmmm...

We hung out for a while longer, then started drifting off to our respective tents. Fur, Sam, Siri and I went out and grabbed food from the remaining food stand, punned and joked for a while while we munched, then retired for the night.

And here I am, again, with Rivulets and Violets calming me down, soothing an emo soul...

Further bulletins as events warrant - and I regain consciousness.
