mine's on the 45.

yeah, so it's been a year since i've posted and everything's gone to hell and back and got the t-shirt. the company i work for has turned into bizarro-land, a caricature of what it was a few months ago, but we, the grunts in the trenches, code on and play our MP3s at ungodly levels.

deadlines come and go, but fatboy slim's mix of cornershop will always be there.

random thoughts and reflections: the seductive power of belonging can never be underestimated. it is a deep and profound need to belong to someone. to be connected in an exclusive and unique way with someone. to think of someone and know that they are thinking of you is like nothing else. anyone who says it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved doesn't know what they're talking about. ignorance is bliss! 

other random thoughts and reflections: The Two That Cannot Be Named, Lest The Forces OF Melodrama Be Summoned, look like their year long collision course with romance will culminate soon. Those in the know will find this thoroughly amusing. batten down the hatches everybody, the ride's about to start....

Further bulletins as events warrant.
