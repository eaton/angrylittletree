A good night, all things considered. Got work done, hung out with my small group from church and my team cleaned up at Cerebellum... a cross between trivial pursuit and pictionary. Fleshed out some ideas for my <A HREF="http://www.havana-mod.com">Eternal Unending Personal Side Project</a>, and hung out with Jeff Benson to discuss metaprogramming and his Artisant project. And then! Tonight, I come home and discover that my buddy Mike from the west coast -- the one who is my RP soul brotha, is looking at jobs right here in my current city. It would kick mighty booty if he were in town.
