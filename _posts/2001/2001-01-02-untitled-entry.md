Something is amiss. 

Either I've been reading too much of Zeitgeist, or the headache is getting to me, or my donuts at 9am stunt screwed up some serious shit in the fabric of the universe. I feel like I'm strangely out of context, like the moment I woke up at 12:15, I'd poked through a mirror version of reality where everything is the same but we use Hindi instead of English. 

I picked up my phone when I got in to work, voicemail light blinking. Obscene phone call. A few minutes ago, my cell phone rang, and I half expected Jim to tell me there was a package from Turkey with my name on it. It was Dad, asking if he could use my socket wrenches. Things have taken on a sheen of unreality and I'm not sure how to kick things back onto the tracks. I looked back at the last couple decades of my life, and the strangeness of the narrative suddenly snapped into black and white relief. I've been using up a whole freaking lot more weirdness than most people. Not personal weirdness -- just situational weirdness. Try as I might, I'm a pretty normal individual. I don't do anything exceptional or spectacular, with the exception of getting around to what I do earlier than most people. 

But oh, the settings. 

Rochelle's amish bonnet kick. Some chick on the east coast stealing my poetry and using it to seduce one of my friends. 700 Club appearances and conversations with authors and politicians. Maria disappearing into the mist and veering into sharp melodrama. The breakup and a dramatic on-the-knee proposal in the middle of November. My family's KGB connections and my old office's missing lawyer. Jim and his whacked secret agent vibe. Prophets chatting me up on the Internet and mentioning what a whacked out year 2000 was going to be. 

Something's going to have to give. 

2001 is going to be a kicker of a year. I can feel it. 

I need a drink.
