so it's time to get new glasses, and i make my way to the optometrist's office today. four hundred prescription lens dollars later, i've got proof that i'm glaucoma-free, and an order of shades and normal glasses arriving in a week. i like 'em. they're stylish. they're me.

the followup? i actually hit the salon for the first time in my life. my hair's been morphing into a mushroom over a preiod of two months or so, and i couldn't come to a decision about what style i wanted, where i wanted to get it cut, etc. so i impulsed into a salon out at the mall and asked if they took walk-ins.

they did.

an hour later i was trying to figure out when 'haircut' morphed into 'complimentary massage, latte, shampoo, and styling' in american vocabulary. i'm certainly not complaining.
