So after a long nap (missing Miranda Stone) I made tracks for the EG show at the Dark Rave tent. I soon discovered that there didn't seem to BE a dark rave tent. In actuality it was shoved behind the Cornerstone Prom building, with no lights, no audio tech, and one monitor. On a slope. With no lubricant.

In other words, nastiness. Joey was in the middle of a valiant setup when the RMC contingent showed up and Rob Reid jumped in to do sound, The rest of us offered moral support and within 30 minutes or so, he had a kickin' little 4 song set going. We thrashed and thrashed well. Chuck was enthused as was to be expected, it being his first EG live show. Despite hellish sound, bad turf, and no prepped tech, Joey did it. Chuck and I sang the We Love Joey Song between sets.

I stuck around for a bit while the dark rave kicked off, but I there were too many Hot Chicks In Leather With Glowsticks(tm). I grooved about for a couple songs and drifted out.  Bwaha -- Sheltershed played a really solid song that was basically the Summoner background music with a heavy beat loop shoved underneath it. I kept imagining leather clad ravers colliding with a bunch of cheeto-crazed RPGers. Cage match! Cage match!

Fortunately Joey will be playing another show tomorrow in the HM tent. Hee hee. Dark rave. HM. Joey. Hee.
