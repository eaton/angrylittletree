Weekend recap:

Took the train into the city after work, to avoid nasty nasty traffic in 290, and discovered that it's actually quite relaxing and convenient. Zounds! Met Trin's brother, which was fun, then adjourned to the Sir and Jess apartment to watch cowboy bebop and repair jess's ailing windows box. As it turns out, it was simply a boxload of old oudated registry entries mucking things up. We all crashed soon after and I hiked back out to the train station with Danny when we woke up, took the train back, and did some back car-twiddling before hitting the road for Champaign.

Long drive follows. Microcasette recorder journaling. Bon Voyage, Aleixa, and The Cure playing on the discman. Subway and freetos on the passengers seat while I drive. And then -- Jason. We laughed and hi-fived as I got out of the car, then promptly began dissing each other. Met Wally and Sherri and Toby (the world's cutest baby from the looks of it. he has a toy rubber ducky. this makes him cool immediately).

We hung out all evening, played Red Faction on the PS2, and got a brief tour of the Volition offices. Many many nifty gaming toys litter the offices and hallways, including an old Smash TV coin op machine. Tres Geek Chic.

Discussion of web stuff followed, and it looks like I'll be helping out on the massivivid site for the next month or so. Logos, slogans, and other miscellany were exchanged before Jason and I retired to play Red Faction multiplayer. He's far too good with the railgun for his own good. I'll have to eliminate him.

We also discussed The New Jersey situation (the choicest euphemism I've ever coined, if I do say so myself). It's as baffling as ever, on both Jason's front and mine, but we made some good headway in figuring out how we should approach it.

Morning came -- more Red Factioning followed, then theological discussions and bad double-entendres over bagels with Wally and Jason. We chilled fro the rest of the morning and afternoon, then I hit the road and headed home. It's the perfect drive, really -- just long enough that you have the time and distance to separate yourself from the world you're normally in... but short enough to make the trip in a day or a weekend and not feel rushed. I need to do it more often, if only for the long stretches of uninterrupted contemplating time.

And then I got home and got an IM from Maria.

The universe laughed.

I blinked.

Cut to next scene, cue soundtrack.
