Goodness. Phi kind of sucked, actually, except for the parts Ben and Deacon played. I said they should let Ben do the vocals, but that would basically make Phi into The People. From the sound of it, they just haven't had a chance to practice together for live shows and the CD is a lot tighter.

Much wandering around, much merch tent browsing, and some hooking up with FuR and Siri. We hiked back to the camp and played blackjack for a while, then Stan and Jess and Danny wandered back at the same time, and we all chilled in the Planet Fur tent. We broke out the bubble bottles, including FuR's candy bubbles. Cheery flavored bubbles. Woo! We all dove around the inside of the tent, bonking ourselves on chairs and floors trying to bite the bubbles out of the air. Siri is heading out and coming back Thursday night/friday morning, so we won't see her for a while. New Jersey. Fur was doing security at the Decap tent, but after we all drifted out to the main road, we discovered that the power had been out for an hour and a half. Bwahah! Hardcore unplugged. Hee. Teehee. Ahem. *Cough.*
