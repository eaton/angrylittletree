three cheers for things I should be okay with but get pissed about instead. immaturity manages to jump out and body-check me when i'm least expecting it, i think. it's really annoying to me. even moreso than the things that irritate me in the first place.

i aspire to the kind of detached zen-master mellowness that leaves one unaffected by any external circumstances. i realize, at least on most levels, that this is an unhealthy aspiration. but it doesn't stop me from wanting it.hey, i can ask for whatever i want, the rest is up to santa...
