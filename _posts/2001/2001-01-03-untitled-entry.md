OK, I think I figured out what was bugging me. I had a brush with post-structuralism, and I started viewing my personal narrative from too great of a distance. That will ALWAYS mess with you. I had a big old raging discussion with mom about the concept, then tossed around ideas with siri and jess a bit. siri's always fun to talk philosophy with, since she'll respond with quirky off-kilter stuff. which means that she actually GETS philosophy and appreciates the inherent strangeness.

Work went well, and many defects were vanquished. Geneer is truly a fun place to work, and the level of job related melodrama is shockingly low. It's as if the place actually works the way a place of employment should. How novel! Jeff Benson and I talked music while waiting for the microwaves at lunch, and I drove him to the auto shop after work. He mentioned that he was really glad that I was on the project, and that I was picking up on stuff really fast. I'm never sure how to replay to that kind of stuff. Dodge it? Say thanks and look smug? Chuckle? I tend to divert it with a return compliment, or attribute it to something other than my own skill/gift/work. After all, eCanvas made the middleware work more reliably, right? Yeah... good dodge. Good save.

All things considered, though, it was very encouraging to hear Jeff say that. I have a lot of respect for him as a developer. His idea to speed up the site by caching the database hits for rendering the site's menus was inspired. One tweak that tripled page load times in many situations.

Post-work, I grabbed dinner at Yu's Mandarin with Brandy and Jeff. It was a lot of fun, Brandy was cute as always, and I discovered she's now dating a guy who did some overseas work in (!) Cuba. Eeeeenteresting. I suppose it's what I deserve for waiting so long to even call her. But the dinner was fun, and hanging out at Borders was as well. I picked up a book by foucault and shall begin dissecting it soon.
