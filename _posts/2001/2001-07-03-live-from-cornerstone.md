Waking up at cornerstone is never truly voluntary. It's just what happens when your body loses the war against ambient noise and says to your brain, "Dude. Time to get up and shut up those people with the Papa Roach CD." Seriously though, it's cool. The system ensures that you never miss too much cool stuff.

Stan and I hit the road ysterday around 10:00, and made good time with a couple of missed turns and backtracks. At least we never wandered into Iowa by mistake. ;-)  In downtown Galesburg, we asked for directions toBushnell at the chamber oof commerce and someone asked, "Going to Cornerstone, right?" It felt good to be recognized. ;-)

Upon arrival we took a good couple of hours trying to find a campsite and get set up, finally settling on the couple square feet next to the Planet Fur tent. Yay! Hopefully my tent pitching skills will be proven -- I hear fat randrops pounding on the rainfly at the moment, and I'll be in a world of yuck if all my stuff gets soaked. But hey, it'd be tradition! ;-)

Saw Celestial Static play last night, even though the fest doesn't start until this afternoon.  They set up a big tent and amps and equipment, and in the grand tradition of Pre Cornerstone Generator Shows drew a sizeable crowd. Rawk.

Met up with the Decap crowd at their stage, which was fun -- apparently JohnnySynth has one of my photos as his desktop. Cool.

We were all pretty smashed after the drive and crashed early by cornerstone standards -- midnight. Zounds. Nine hours of sleep. What's the world coming to?

Well. Rain's stopped... time to head out. Cornerstone ho!
