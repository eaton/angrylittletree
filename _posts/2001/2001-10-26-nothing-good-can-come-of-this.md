So my last day at <A HREF="http://www.geneer.com">Geneer,</A> come and gone. After coming home, crashing briefly, posting a resume to <A HREF="http://www.ftd.com">FTD</a> and dreaming of becoming a florist, I worked on some freelance projects and then drove off to meet the ex-coworkers at <A HREF="http://www.gameworks.com">gameworks.</A> Here's a hint to any who might be teetering on the edge: karaoke with coworkers is never, never, never, NEVER a good idea. It's fun, but it's a BAD idea. Even worse is Dance Dance Revolution as a followup. I traded my dignity for a $20 credit! Sawb!
