Huzzah! The tent survived the first hit of the rains, so I think I'll be safe unless we get massive monsoons. Hooked up with the RMC crew at the BBQ tent and caught up for a while. Lo and behold, Chuck Pearson made it this year and I was finally able to meet up with him. Much geeking ensued as four of us beamed assorted palm freeware back and forth. Overheard Havalina Rail Company and waited out the downpour, then trekked to Chuck's campsite and checked for water damage. Lucky breaks all around...

And now, the sun is out. Fur's watching a DVD in her truck, Jess and Danny are getting supplies at the dorm, and now I'm hanging at the Decap stage with Little Brett, Brad, Devon, etc etc.

Life is good.
