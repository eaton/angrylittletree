I enjoy online comics. There are a lot of crummy ones out there, but there are some gems, like <a href="http://www.megatokyo.com">MegaTokyo</a>, <a href="http://www.sluggy.com">Sluggy Freelance</a>, <a href="http://www.baldwinpage.com/bruno.html">Bruno</a>, <a href="http://www.gpf-comics.com">GPF</a>, and a couple of others I peek at infrequently. Megatokyo in particular has grabbed me lately -- it's rare to find a strip so clued in to the Anime/Gaming Geek culture, so well drawn, and so refreshingly *likeable* in one package.

Megatokyo ALSO has a fun archive of rants by the writers and artists. The latest one, on the topic of emotional connection with characters, sums up the anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion perfectly: " While some people will debate with me on the likability of the characters... the ending is basically Hideaki Anno rolling naked in a pile of money, smoking a fat stogie and giving the fans the one-finger salute as he does obscene things to all eight cels of animation the TV show used. After learning what the future of the show was, I stopped watching at around episode 11. Then Ed tied me to a chair, propped my eyes open and forced me to watch The End of Evangelion while he laughed maniacally and played a synth version of Ode to Joy on his walkman..."

Remember the night I did that, Jason? Mwaaaahahahah...
