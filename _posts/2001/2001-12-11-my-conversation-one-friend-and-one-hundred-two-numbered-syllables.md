a kaleidoscope
each day the light shines on you
more facets revealed

<i>praying mantis me
always folding on myself
tucking heart inside</i>

not a bumble bee
the single sting won't kill you
fields of flowers bloom

<i>suppose, then, i am
a wasp tempted by the thought
of stings limitless</i>

pain is familiar
conquered and survived in time
or do you fear love

<i>cynicism, natch
the desperate refuge
of romantics frail</i>
