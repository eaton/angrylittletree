And here I am, Sunday morning, getting everything packed up and ready to go. the People were awesome with their 7 song set, and we all gave Ben major props when he walked off the stage. He's so shockingly rockstar that it isn't even funny. That's why he gets all the chicks(tm).

I need to get a jumpstart for my car - apparently the AC was left on all night without the engine running, and when I realized that it was still going the battery had already been sucked dry. Doh!

But cleanup aside, Cornerstone's over. Sigh. Time to start prepping for next year. :-)
