i just had a vision of myself at 35, sitting in an apartment typing on  something and feeding goldfish. going off for a weekend of watching movies and  thinking of calling old friends who've moved off and married and have kids and  dogs and houses and hassles and stress and hurts and love. and deciding  against it. because they're always busy. they don't have free time, like i  does. to do all the things i want to do. and then sitting down, and watching  a movie, and falling asleep there. typing.

i spent new years eve trying to get the robis server up and running, watching plans for a party fall through, working late, and trying to convince someone on the net not to kill themselves. i watched clean digits blink to 0:00 on my watch, convinced i hadn't, and fell into bed.

i spent the first of the year at work, trying to grapple with windows nt and a host of configuration issues.
