so here i am and its late and im listening to new order in the dark and writing without punctuation and thinking that this should be an interesting letter because i'm just barely awake and i have to get the jpegs from this weekends trip downstate posted online for brian to look at for this months copy of the newsletter that i lay out and he edits but even when i finish that up im going to have a lot of stuff on my mind because i talked to a bunch of kids on saturday night about god and stuff like that and a lot of them laughed but that was probably a good thing because i did crack a couple jokes.

but im pretty tired now and all the stuff is running together and i only remember driving home at midnight with stan and christy and laughing about mcdonalds promotional toys and listening to dakoda motor company songs and goth cds and singing along with jennifer knapp at the top of our lungs and stopping on the side of the road to take pictures of the pretty lights in the skyline of a distant city. 

 o/` every time i see you falling i get down on my knees and pray waiting for that final moment to hear you say the words that i cant say... o/`
 
 im tired. g'night.
