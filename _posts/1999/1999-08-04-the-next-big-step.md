words fail. preparation for the willow creek association leadership summit has been a herculean task. In addition to the structure modifications and other political got potatoes (namely, the unannounced redesign of the willow creek church home page that pushed the WCA into a subsidiary role), the willownet demo table has been a top priority. seven G3 macs, a bundle of Ethernet cables as thick as my arm, and plenty of improvosation -- that's the recipe.

paul has been my assistant chef.

working with paul to get the table set up has been a fascinating experience -- he seems to be perceived as the troublemaker in some ways, perhaps lumped in with the 'knowledgable but annoying boys who make things work'

[stuff: the great great food. the discovery of keith baldwin's supreme excellence and awesome business card. paul's inherent nate-ishness and spectacular communication skills. willow's grandness. etc etc.]
