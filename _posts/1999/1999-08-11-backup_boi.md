at work today a woman was burning off the last few shots of a roll of film. took quick pics of mike mike moon, prather, and me sitting there. i'm beginning to really hate the idea of pictures being taken of me.

i'm sucking myself deeper and deeper into a depressive spiral -- self-hatred is such an easy drug. it's the perfect drug... i try to write poetry about her, but i fall down a few lines through. and if i dwell long enough to gain understanding, i find myself too deep to pull out again.

i loved her. i still love her. she told me she loved me, but they were lies. should I believe the same pretty, hollow words from someone else's lips?

that night i woke in the dark, sheets plastered to my body in the sticky heat of july, breath coming in shallow gasps. i had startled myself awake, the dream of her incomplete. rubbed my eyes and untangled my legs, stumbling to the shower to fight off sleep. to fight off new nightmares.

she'd come to me in my dreams, i remembered as i groped for knobs and faucets, carefree and on his arm. we met each others eyes across a mall -- or was it a cafe? -- and she stared for a long moment or two before laughing in slow motion and steering him in the other direction. turning him and clinging to that big ox's arm of his, my dream-image of him a charicature of everything i would never be. strong. handsome. smooth. confident. with her.

I leaned against the shower wall as icy water hammered my shoulders, my cheek pressed to cold mildewed tile. eyes closed, i reminded myself again: i was over her.

thing to be angry about number nine hundred and twelve. martha and ed, her dysfunctional friends. she IS martha. i'm backup_boy.
