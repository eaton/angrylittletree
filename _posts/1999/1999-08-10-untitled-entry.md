i called alison today, after a few days of fruitless answering-machine tag. she'd sent me email after i fired off an angsty rant to The-List. "Hey, how are you? It's been way too long." So I made up for it, and we spent a few minutes catching up, laughing, and getting to know each others' voices again. She has a pair of kittens now, and she got a raise. she seems to be doing fine -- i told her about my summer minus maria, a detail whose intricacies make casual conversation difficult to impossible.
