<i>o/` i thought i was mistaken

it was an interesting, and mind-boggling, day at work. arrived at eight fifteen and right off the bat, paul (the EG fan I sit next to) grabbed me and drafted me to help fix the WCA CEO's projection screen computer. in five minutes he had top execs arriving for a meeting about willownet and the WCA... and his machine wouldn't work. awk. turns out it was just a botched quicktime install, and a re-install and reboot was all that was needed. huzzah...

spent most of the rest of the day painstakingly dissecting the willownet site, tracking links and catalogging the 750 megs or so of raw data that sit on the server. quicktime movies, realaudio files, PDFs, graphics, sheet music, HTML files, database templates, perl scripts.... you name it, we've got a little of it there.

my plans to drive to kansas in early august, with danny and the gang, have fallen through due to the conference that will be going on at willow. i don't mind too much really -- the prospect of an extended road trip, with 20+ hours on the road over one weekend, were feeling less and less adventurous and more foolhardy as time went on.

so after work i drove over to jason's and bummed with {gang-jason}. broke the news about the cancelled trip, and danny screamed out loud for a couple minutes, then laughed and slipped into a cynical pissy mood for the rest of the evening. sigh.

slipping into more and more of a depressive spiral regarding maria. i'm trying to decide if i should just slide into abject bitterness and hate myself for it, or try to remain soft and be hurt for it, over and over and over and over and over and over and over. thanks, maira, for proving my nagging suspicion that to women i'm either a convenient toy or a piece of shit.

*sighs*

 for all her talk of not wanting me to pull back inside, she managed to singlehandedly convince me that withdrawl is the best route. listened to ani difranco's "dilate" after work. 'untouchable face' is so painfully amazing...
