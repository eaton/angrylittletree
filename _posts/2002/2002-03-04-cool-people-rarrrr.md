so a friend applies for membership in the Gurst Posse, a random crowd of screwy online folks that i am a part of (under the moniker 'story'). so in her application, she writes a limerick about everyone in the posse. and thus, a limerick about me:

our Story is known for his wit
and his writing so chock full of grit
with good grammar and spelling
and taut storytelling
We admire the stuff that he's writ.

we're all voting for her. note to other applicants: if you want to butter up someone who hangs out in textual environements, go for the written word. it works!
