Supplies running low, the men are failing. Send bacon.

Seriously though, it's not going too badly. Consulted the office's other vegetarian for advice and she suggested the broccoli and cheese baked potato/spring mix salad combination at Wendy's. I added fries and a frosty. It's a cruel, harsh world and I need all the encouragement I can get.

*slurp slurp slup frosty slurp*

So far, so good.
