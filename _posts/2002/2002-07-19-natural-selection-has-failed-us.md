<A HREF="http://www.syracuse.com/news/poststandard/index.ssf?/base/news-3/1026898737191180.xml">Acording to the Syracuse Post-Standard,</a> young Eric River's parents are gravely concerned about lax security at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo. So concerned, in fact, that they're preparing to sue the zoo for not securing its premises.

They know that the zoo is lax because their son Eric managed to sneak into the zoo at night, past the armed guard, over the eight foot barbed-wire fence, through another eight foot barbed wire fence, and find himself a friendly-looking snow leopard to toss raw meat at.

Clearly, the fact the the leopard proceeded to grab Eric and slash him up a bit is the zoo's fault.
