"Kiss The Dragon" is an extremely depressingly bad movie. Jet Li is good as always, playing himself. The rest of the film just doesn't do it. Romeo Must Die did a great job of packing creative fight sequences into a coherent plot, but this film just... just... ugh. Good kung-fu gimmicks, but dialog and scripting that left me cringing in pain.
