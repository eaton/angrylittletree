<A HREF="http://www.btexact.com/white_papers/downloads/WP106.pdf">It's British Telecom's timeline for the future. Yay!</A>

<A HREF="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20020217/tc_nm/life_britain_future_dc_2&cid=581">Hilights</A> include retinal implants linked to external cameras in 2004, 'Smart Barbies' demanding their own allowances in 2003, an AI earning a masters degree in 2014 and winning a nobel prise in 2018, and room temperature superconductors in 2020.

Most of the ideas seem a little ambitious, but it is some interesting stuff... For comparison, <A HREF="http://www.havana-mod.com">Havana Modern's</A> version of the future doesn't even have AIs recognized as sentient until the 2050's.
