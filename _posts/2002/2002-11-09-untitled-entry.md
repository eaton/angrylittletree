both underworld and the future sound of london have released new cds with *vocals*... like, actual lyrics, not just sampled loops.

i have no idea what to make of this. it's like talking to a childhood friend and discovering they've had a third arm surgically attached. sure, it's cool... but it takes some getting used to.

although this track will make most excellent eyes-closed-face-to-the-open-sky-thinking-about-the-future-in-the-dark music.
