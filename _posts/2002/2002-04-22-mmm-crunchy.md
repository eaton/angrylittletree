Well, I've been messing around with Reason and Acid lately, as well as some assorted samples I grabbed last time I was at o'hare. In my eternal quest to try everything at least once, I whipped up a crummy little ditty. It's just some loops and samples, nothing at all musical, but it was fun splicing it together.
