Eight inch veggie sub from Potbelly's. Mushrooms, cheese, lettuce, more mushrooms. And some mushrooms.

Vanilla malt.

Potato chips.

Still going well, although last night, caugh myself fantasizing about pepperjack sirloin with sauted mushrooms. I think that's a violation of the spirit of the experiment.
