...I'm onsite at a contract programming gig in Schaumburg, pounding away in VB on a stopgap app for a company that wants to automate some data collection tasks.

Any chances that someone out there knows of a VB6 DLL or API interface to compare a stored bitmap to a region on the screen, eh? ;)

Wheeee!
