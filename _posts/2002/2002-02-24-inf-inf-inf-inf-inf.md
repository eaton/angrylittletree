<img src="/files/lj-photos/random/pic1.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10>So the weekend was interesting -- worked on code most of Friday, then caught a late night movie with Jen. We <A HREF="http://www.moviephone.com">missed the last showing</A> at a couple theaters by minutes, so we bopped over to <A HREF="http://www.blockbuster.com">blockbuster</A> and picked up <A HREF="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movie-1105582/">Memento!</A> I'd gotten some positive recommendations from assorted friends, and we weren't disappointed. Jen railed against the ambiguous ending, but we both liked it and I seriously dug the way the five-minute snippets of film untangled the mystery as the main character would experience it. What is memory? What is wishful thinking? How sanitary is it to give yourself a tat with a sewing needle and a ballpoint pen? Aieeeeee.

<img src="/files/lj-photos/random/pic2.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10>Woke up earlyish saturday and made the drive down to Champaign to gte some band shots for Cosmetic. They're trying to get a last minute press kit ready in time for Cstone, and it's coming together okay. The shots themselves were only so-so given the time we had to work with, but I got some other shots along the way and around the house, and I was really happy with how they turned out. (see spammy imbedded images in this entry for examples.) It was cool to see <A HREF="http://www.predicate.net/random/jason_baby.jpg">Jason</A>, but it would've been nice to have more time to chill and talk. He's turning into a pretty good producer, and it's fun to watch.

After an extended fast, I installed <A HREF="http://www.planetunreal.com">UT</A> again and downloaded all the <A HREF="http://infiltration.sentrystudios.com">INF 2.86 installers, map packs, and Assorted Cool Stuff</A>. 2.87 is coming out soon with all sorts of <A HREF="http://www.megatokyo.com/index.php?strip_id=9">5\/\/33+</A> enhancements, and I don't want to be out of practice.

<img src="/files/lj-photos/random/pic3.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10>Man. You play Counterstrike for a few months and you forget how demanding a <A HREF="http://infiltration.sentrystudios.com/modules/Diner_Wrapper/html/forum/test_index.php?url=http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=104992">realism-oriented game</A> can be. You forget simple things like not being able to run 35mph all the time, not being able to jump 25 feet without dropping your gun, not being able to shoot to save your life unless you drop and brace yourself to steady the shot... Played a couple of the new maps I never had a chance to check out when the current version shipped, and they were pretty intense, even with bot-on-bot action dominating most of the games.

After extensive testing, I still stand by my trusty <A href="http://infiltration.sentrystudios.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Diner_Wrapper&file=index&req=ShowFile&file_wrap=html/armory/index.htm#m16">M16-A2/M203</A>, with a <a href="http://infiltration.sentrystudios.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Diner_Wrapper&file=index&req=ShowFile&file_wrap=html/armory/index.htm#57">Five-seveN</A> for sneaking. We'll see how the new loadout additions in 2.87 change things -- the silenced <a href="http://infiltration.sentrystudios.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Diner_Wrapper&file=index&req=ShowFile&file_wrap=html/armory/index.htm#socom">SOCOM</a> looks tempting, but the <a href="http://infiltration.sentrystudios.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Diner_Wrapper&file=index&req=ShowFile&file_wrap=html/armory/index.htm#g11">G11</a> will have to be something special for me to put down <A HREF="http://infiltration.sentrystudios.com/modules/My_eGallery/gallery/action/shot0130.jpg">Old Reliable.</A>

<img src="/files/lj-photos/random/pic4.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10>Random thoughts: N*Sync. Willie Nelson. KISS. Earth, Wind, and Fire. Gloria Estefan. Who was smoking crack when they set up the closing ceremonies?

Seeing the entire Chinese delegation waving Chinese flags to a Christine Agulara song... that was *my* favorite Olympic moment. Coming up at the summer olympics: Fidel Castro does the Macarena!
