So I've been plugging away at the contract work on my plate and it's starting to show good progress, thankfully. Two client sites should be working in short order.

I've been trying out an insanely cool IM client called <A HREF="http://www.trillian.cc">Trillian</a>... it's a single unified interface for AIM, MSN, Yahoo, IRC, and ICQ. How cool is that? Yeah. Cool. It also supports the gratuitously cool 'translucent windows.' I've already set it up with all my accounts, and have received and sent IMs on every imaginable chat service without having to think about a different interface, different client apps, or different features. This is what good software is about -- eliminating needless thinking from my life. Why should I have to think about which service my friend uses when I want to say hi? I shouldn't. And that's the problem Trillian solves. It's cool. I approve.
