I got a new library card. A <i>college</i> library card. I immediately abused my privileges by checking out an impossible-to-find copy of Paolo Soleri's <i>Arcology: The City in the Image of Man.</i> So yummy! And also a copy of <i>Sverre Fehr: Works, Projects, Writings</i>... an overview of the work of a spiffy Norwegian architect.

Oh yes. Jeff is in heaven.
