Visit <A HREF="http://www.norad.mil/">NORAD</A> and return to those early, innocent days of the web when textured background images were all the rage, sidebars were festooned with God-awful button clip art, and animated blinking 'NEW!!!' GIFs marked any content added since Earth's crust hardened.

Somewhat more polished is the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/">Homeland Security</A> website. It has a friendly little GIF button that displays the country's current alert status. What's next? The JurisprudenceCam?
