In other words...

I had a long evening, with lots of interesting discussion. We went to a Leadership Training session at Willow, and it was kind of strange. Since Graceland is part of the single adults ministry (which has a well deserved reputation as a 40-somthing meat market), we felt quite out of place. Afterwards, Jenn and I saw the movie "The Rookie." It was good.
