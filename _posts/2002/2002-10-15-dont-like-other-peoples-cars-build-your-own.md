It's been a long, long time, baby.

I've been neglecting my LJ, and I think I know why. The more I have on my mind, the less comfortable i am randomly spewing it out, I think. I feel the need to properly form my thoughts, to shape them into something coherent, before I let it rip. The more I have rolling around upstairs, though, the more time it takes to do that parsing.

So it slides, and slides, and soon I realize that I've gone for weeks without an entry.

So I'll start off with something easy: a rant! C:Net's <a href="http://www.downloads.com">Downloads.Com</a> has the following promo blurb on their front page today:

<i>
Why settle for the same old boring fonts created by other people? If you want your writing to really reflect your individuality, design yourself a font. Every word you write will have your distinctive mark. We show you how to get started!
</i>

That sounds fun, doesn't it? *Other* peoples' fonts don't capture the uniqueness that makes you special! Roll your own font! Of course, it doesn't mention the fact that creating any typeface classier than Comic Sans takes a hell of a lot of work, experience, and study. Like, years. That's not elitism, and it's not an attempt to discourage people interested in typography from pursuing their interests and talents. But to imply that anyone who downloads a font program from their web site will have even the slightest clue about what makes a good typeface is disingenuous. It's an insult to genuine typographers who pursue the *craft* of typeface design.
