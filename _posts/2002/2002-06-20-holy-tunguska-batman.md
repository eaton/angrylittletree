Uh, yeaaaah.... So, apparently <A HREF="http://skyandtelescope.com/news/current/article_641_1.asp">Earth was nearly pegged last friday by a passing asteroid.</a> Sure, sure, it was 75,000 miles away. That's not exactly spitting distance, but on a solar scale, the moon itself is a whopping 225,000 miles away.

The really unsettling thing is that this rock, capable of destroying, say, Chicago and its suburbs upon impact, wasn't spotted by astronomers until Monday. MONDAY. Three days after it nearly clipped us.

If we're going to lose a couple of million people to a football-field-sized hunk of space rock, we should at least have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449208133/002-1101588-9801663">enough warning to get in</A> <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305311463/002-1101588-9801663">a couple good blows</A> <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6305232660/002-1101588-9801663">of our own.</a>
