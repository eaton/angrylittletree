Natalie: bbc is reporting that j lo and ben afflect have postponed their valentines day wedding.  does this mean that the world is going to stop spinning now?
mozarT: I thought I felt something jerk earlier.
Natalie: http://www.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30500-12202193,00.html
Natalie: I thought I should tell you because it instructs "relax boys, j lo calls off wedding"
Natalie: so, you can relax now, apparently you now have a real chance to get with j lo
Natalie: all because she called off her wedding to ben afflect
mozarT: *whew*
mozarT: I know MY will to live is restored.
Natalie: you're so lucky.
Natalie: I wish girls could realax too and be reassured that they have a legitimate shot with j lo now
mozarT: *comfort* there's always Ben...
Natalie: but I would be afraid that his best friend matt damon would poison his love for me
mozarT: *comfort* I know Matt's always hated you after you broke his heart in '99.
Natalie: that vengeful bastard.
