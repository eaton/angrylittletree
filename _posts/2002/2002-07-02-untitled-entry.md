We're stopping at a McDonalds, clicking off the Fleming and John CD that was blaring on Jason's boom box. We pile out to grab arch deluxes, with much stretching and yawning and commenting about the music selection. The three of us (and Leo) plop down at a table and start talking. It's a nonstop stream of consciousness three-person rant-slash-joke, the usual fare for Beck, Jason and I. Leo seems a little unnerved -- that's a good sign, indicating that he's still sane.

A couple people walk by and say, 'Hey, are you heading to Cornerstone?' Ends up, it's the girls who ran the now-famous Lemon Shake Ups stand last year.We chat for a while and they tell us that it's about two hours to Bushnell the way traffic is going. Cool! Cornerstone people are *everywhere!*

As we head out, Beck blinks, staring into the foliage-covered area behind our table. The salt and pepper shaker have been set atop one of each other in the relative privacy of the leaves. Salt and Pepper, in flagrante delicto. We all stare and blink for a minute and leave, laughing our heads off.

Things go pretty well after that point, until I look up on the highway and notice the "Welcome to Iowa" sign.

"Jason? Are we supposed to be leaving Illinois?"

Blinking. "Oh. Crap." Pause. "Well... Joyce is leading, so she probably knows where we're going."

This comforts me, and we bop around to Joy Electric for a while until I notice that in Joyce's car, up ahead of us, there's wild gesturing going on, and other passengers are unfolding AAA maps.

Thirty minutes later, we're standing in a Thrifty Mart or something, getting directions and corn nuts and lemon drops and Mountain Dew. Joyce and Pam chew me out for buying Dew. "Doesn't your mother want grandchildren? Come on! You're killing off the Eaton line with every sip!" I respond with a heartfelt rant about the evil of urban legends, and chug a few gulps of Dew just to drive the point home. Json and Beck laugh uproariously, while Leo and the clerk seem a little scared.
