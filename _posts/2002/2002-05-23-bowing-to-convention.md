...I fill out a LJ survey.

Gratifying moment of the night: talking with Scott, Rachel, and Jenn after the Graceland Crew met tonight... Scott asks where I got my degree. I grin off-kilter. "Well, I didn't actually go to college." He laughs at me and asks, "No, seriously." Then goes wide-eyed.

That's always kind of gratifying. For all the work I do and the stuff I read (voracious. I can't help it!) There's always the nagging insecurity that I'm perceived as a lightweight kind of guy, because I was never really part of the 'Academic World.' Purely a bit of an ego boost.

And now, on to the survey.

<!--break-->

Have you ever...
1. Fallen for your best friend?: Yes.
2. Made out w/ JUST a friend?: Nope.
3. Been rejected?: Of course. Who hasn't?
4. Been in love?: Mmmm. This one always leads to second-guessing in retrospect, doesn't it? I'll say 'yeah.'
5. Been in lust?: I guess. I tend to dismiss those and shrug them off, though.
6. Used someone?: Yeah, sadly.
7. Been Used: Mm. I tend to brush those things away and chalk it up to misinderstanding, or my own foolishness, rather than malice on the parts of others. I guess, in some ways, yes, I have been. I think that the person(s) doing the using were not malicious; just troubled and needy.
8. Cheated on someone?: No.
9. Been cheated on?: Thankfully, no.
10. Been kissed?: Yep.
11. Done something you regret?: I fear people who answer this question 'No'... There's a danger in living in regret, but a certain degree of introespection, a certain degree of recognizing your mistakes... isn't that necessary for a healthy life?

Who was the last person...
12. You touched? Scott.
13. You talked to? Jenn.
14. You hugged? Scott.
15. You instant messaged? AnthonyTheLoser, the most un-loser-ish guy around.
16. You kissed? No comment.
21. Who broke your heart?: No comment.

Do you...
22. Color your hair? Nah. 
23. Have tattoos? Nope.
24. piercings? Nope! Boy, I'm just boring all around, aren't I?
25. have a girlfriend? Hah! No.
27. own a webcam? I built one out of spare parts for fun at 4am one night.. does that count?
28. ever get off the damn computer? Sure. You have to read and watch movies and hang out with friends and hit concerts *sometime*...
29. Sprechen sie duetsche? Nope.
30. habla espanol? No hablo.
31. Quack? si!

Have you / do you...
32. Stolen anything? No. Once when I was 8 I snuck a friend's GI Joe 'Serpentor' action figure into my bin of toys, but I felt guilty and gave it back to him later.
33. Smoke? Nope. Me and my lungs have this agreement, see. I don't stuff them full of carcinogens and they keep inhaling. It works.
44. Schizophrenic? Not that I *know* of... ;)
45. Obsessive? Depends on the topic.
46. Compulsive? Nah.
47. Obsessive Compulsive? No, excuse me while I spend 40 minutes adjusting the background color on my home page again...

51. Suicidal? Not presently.
52. Obsessed with hate? No... frustrated with people often, but no. Not obsessed with hate.
53. Dream of mutilated bodies, blood, death, and gore? What is this? The goth quiz?
54. Dream of doing those things instead of seeing them? Nope. I generally avoid fantasies of wanton destruction and violence.
55. If you could be anywhere, where would you be? Cuba! Woo!
56. Who would you be with? No comment.
57. What would you be doing? Laying on the ground squinting against the sun talking about a good book.
58. What are you listening to? The hum of the dryer.
59. Can you do anything freakish with your body?Hmmm. I'm double-jointed, but I don't go wrapping myself around things, or anything like that...

62. Is Ice cream the best thing in the world? No, that would have to be Reeces Peanut Butter Cups.
