At some point over the holidays, one of my coworkers purchased a bag full of little plastic cameras that are not, in fact, cameras. Instead, they use AA batteries and a cheap motor drive to fling foam discs out of the lens. It's the sort of Nerf toy James Bond would use.

This means, of course, that the office has degenerated into warring camps of camera-disc-shooters, with nerfdiscs whipping by and bouncing off of walls in endless volleys of attack and counterattack. It's like Nerf Lebanon. If the things didn't have motor drives and a ten-round capacity, it wouldn't be so bad... but now, the high-pitched whine of the shooters feels like the ominous thump-thump-thump of choppers in the distance. War can't be far behind...

I printed out a copy of the swiss flag and positioned it over my desk -- at the moment, foam discs are still arcing over my head, as I'm caught between two combatants, but I hope that they'll respect my neutrality.

If they don't, I'll have to bring in my whistling nerf darts. Not since the days of the Six Pack have I donned the garb of the Nerf Ninja. We all hope it won't come to that.
