...to hang out with a crowd of really cute girls all weekend, and win the final game of cranium with them by knowing random trivia about the stonewall riots. ;-)

but it was fun. and shrek was watched. and many fun random conversations were had. it's been a very unique 2002 so far. meeting maria, writing lyrics, playing tons of cranium, and so on and so forth. more info to come later, when i regain consciousness.
