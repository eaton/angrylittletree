so i'm the administrator of the web site for my church's singles group. we're a pretty... unconventional kind of crew. we are the anti-meat-market. we play ultimate frisbee and lick our wounds over ice cream. we have month-long themes like 'Why Christianity Sucks.' two of the women in our group have come to blows over bears/packers rivalry. it's all in good fun.

so someone, this morning, submitted a link to <a href="http://www.bigchurch.com">BigChurch.</a> It's a singles site. A Christian Singles Site.

Never in my life have I been more frightened.

The words, 'Hey Baby, do you love Jesus?' should never, ever be allowed.

Ever.

EVER.

*long pause*

E-V-E-R.
