So I'm having a meaty conversation about life and love and relationships in an IM window, and I go to visit a URL that someone sent me. Unfortunately, I paste what I'd just said in the conversation, instead of the URL.

IE 6 dutifully interperets this as a search string instead of a URL, and prompty digs up documents that are somehow related to the words: ""Even if the opportunity were to arise, chances are I would simply not have the desire to. I'm just tired, really. Tired of relating to people on a level that gives them any claim to a part of me."

The resulting links are a scary approxomation of my personality.
