So after debugging more code on <A HREF="http://test.predicate.net">The Project</a>, I played a couple of rounds of America's Army and finally managed to get past the evil rope net wall. Turns out I needed to run across the planks instead of the bar in the middle. Sheesh. Mr. Drill Instructor needs to explain his requests a bit more clearly. But after that I got to play with large automatic weapons and explosives on the practice range, and take a quick run through urban assault training. Night vision, yay! Flashbangs, yay! Live ammo, yay!

Carboard cutouts that don't shoot back at me, yay!

So, um, yeah. I'm still in training and they won't let me see actual combat yet. Sigh. I think soon, they're going to let me train with other soldiers. Not using ammo, mind you. But other soldiers.

This game is a tiny little peek at why impatient people would never, ever make it in the Army. If you want to go and blow stuff up, becoming a special effects guy on a low budget movie is your best bet. If you want to run around with 100lbs of equipment on your back and follow shouted commands very, very accurately, join the army.
