Wow. Long-time readers of this journal (that's you, Natalie and Loki) will remember the company I was working for about a year ago. Great place, great people, until it turned inside out and turned into Bizarro-World. At the time I never mentioned its name, but now... <A HREF="http://www.geneer.com">Geneer, Inc.</a> is officially dead. It's strange and sad to see it just disappear like that. Despite the strange, stupid things that happened and the terrible treatment of a lot of the employees during the last days, people suffer when a company folds.
