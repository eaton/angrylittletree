so m242 <A HREF="http://www.cekta.com/M242/">(the palindrome formerly known as problem19)</A> and i hooked up for dinner and laughing and horror last night. for those who aren't familiar with the legend, a recap:

back in The Day, when we were living off the fat of the land and enjoying the dotcom boom, we shared an office block called The Six Pack with a few other miscreants. chaos and mayhem ensued. <A HREF="http://infiltration.sentrystudios.com/">massive games of inf were played.</A> music was looped. m242 and i hit it off, in part because we both derive great pleasure from the who-just-had-the-most-surreal-week one-upmanship game. we are both experts, and it's no longer a competition: we play for the love of the sport.

of course, it all crashed when <A HREF="http://www.geneer.com/">the company flamed out</A> in a dramatic <A HREF="http://www.tmronline.com/A55951/tmrarticles.nsf/39918186ac76b68a8625692400787eb1/4061a9d7df77985986256bdd0000d01b!OpenDocument&Highlight=0,geneer">terrible-management</A>-and-<A HREF="http://www.tmronline.com/A55951/tmrarticles.nsf/39918186ac76b68a8625692400787eb1/d76d98d19915389b86256bdb007e0caf!OpenDocument&Highlight=0,geneer">no-cash-reserves</A> <A HREF="http://www.tmronline.com/A55951/tmrarticles.nsf/39918186ac76b68a8625692400787eb1/ecf678d22bdc539386256bf00079ca1b!OpenDocument&Highlight=0,geneer">sort of way.</A>

we've hooked up on and off over the last year or so -- he was the GM for the shadowrun session i wrote about a while back, and he helped run a sweet show downtown with the chicago asian artists collective. it had live music and political commentary and lots and lots of cute women. (m242 has a good eye for what organizations he's going to get involved with.)

but lo, we've been out of contact for a couple months and we camped at a gloriously, yummily amazing cuban place near my office. Rancho Luna (thank you, trin and siri) has the best food in the universe. i've decided this. try it sometime if you're in the chicago area, you won't be disappointed. the ropa vieja is more than any man deserves.

so mike and i caught up and topped each other's surreal stories for an hour or so, and it was all good, like old times, but without Doug Grimstead's mustachioed visage looming in the background. traded stories and advice and ideas, and even started watering the seed of an idea for a new creative collaboration. it could be cool. keep watching for more info.

in the end, there was adventure that Shall Not Be Spoken Of, and I cackle at his existential angst. but then, he cackles at mine, and that's what we do. friends are good.

don't neglect them.

ph34r them occasionally, but don't neglect them.
