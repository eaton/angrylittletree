Discovered in a <a href="http://www.plastic.com/comments.html?sid=02/11/10/01283875;cid=13">discussion about deregulation and free markets</a>. An interesting answer to the "Government control is baaaaad!" view of absolutely everything.

<blockquote><i>
What really determines whether or not the users of a service get a decent deal is how much say they have over it. In the ideal free market, you have lots of say. If you don't like United Air Lines, Delta will gladly fly you where you need to go. In the free market, you vote with your bucks. The next best thing is government controlled. If you don't like what the city is doing with the local roads, you can express your opinion by voting people in or out of office. The feedback is less direct, so it's not nearly as effective. If you say that socialism was a failure in Russia, it's because Soviets couldn't vote. Systems where there is no feedback mechanisms are the worst. That's what Soviet communism has in common with unregulated monopolies; they do what they want without fear of losing customers or being voted out. 

Infrastructure-heavy systems like highways, the power grid or cable TV networks are called 'natural monopolies' because it's too hard for a competitor to catch up once a monopolist has already built an infrastructure. 

This is why monopolies are so heavily regulated. It's an attempt to restore the feedback loop. Acts like mandating that Verizon lease its lines to rival companies is an attempt to simulate a free market in a natural monopoly situation. For long distance phone service, this worked great; but it can be botched as California blackouts have proven. 

Sometimes infrastructure monopolies can be broken, or at least made more like a free market, by new infrastructures. Cell antennas can be erected faster than land lines can be run. This leapfrogs the evil Verizon(or other favorite monopolist pigs) and forces them to at least try being good to their customers. 

Sometimes monopolies are broken by the sheer volume of discontent (like the Soviet Union, for example). Edison had a brutal monopoly of the equipment used by the Cinema industry, and this may be why the movie biz fled to somewhere far from NYC, and with escape routes to Mexico. This refugee colony is now known and Hollywood. Music fans have staged a revolt against Clear Channel's radio monopoly; who needs a payola DJ to spin lame tunes for you when you have a CD jukebox in your car, or an MP3 player? 

The goal of regulations should be to somehow give consumers a say in the businesses that serve them, whether by making the companies answer to elected officials, or by preventing monopolists from squashing monopoly-breaking innovations. 

Socialism may be 'bad' but unregulated monopolies are even worse! 

Maybe roads and cars are a good model. You drive your competitively bought car on highways built by those you voted for. Nobody ever called a road-building politician a communist ;-)
