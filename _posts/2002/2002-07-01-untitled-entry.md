Goodness, it's been a while since I've updated. It seems like things have just slammed by so fast in the past week or two.

Summarizing has never been one of my strong points. I love to capture the essence of a moment, the nuances of an experience, and record it. Tossing out a bullet-point list of a week's events seems like a cheap shortcut to that part of my psyche. But when things get busy, I slip behind, and before I know it, I've got a week of <i>stuff</i> behind me, and not a bit of written down.

But first, some random links...

<a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/07/01/spyware_inc/index.html" target="_blank">Dot-com noir,</a> a Salon magazine article on the bizarre (and illegal) mechanations of a now-dead spam company.

<a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/62951.html" target="_blank">Freedom to Deceive,</a> an almost-amusing summary of the illegal tactics Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, and other now-busted corporations used to bilk shareholders and investors.

<a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/63062.html" target="_blank">Qaeda and Hezbollah seen in alliance of terror,</a> says the Washington Post. Most unsettling is the implication that Sunni and Shiite terrorists will soon be willing to lay down their theological and cultural differences, united by mutual hatred of the United States. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58700-2002Jun27.html" target="_blank">Salman Rushdie weighs in</a> on the topic in his column for the New York Post.

And finally, <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/parachutepants/" target="_blank">Parachute Pants.</a>

Now, on with my week...

The Java class has been going pretty well. I'm still enjoying the benefits of a few years in the industry, and my spidey sense gives me the pragmatic "You realy don't want to do that, Jeff -- add error checking and break that portino out to a separate function" type of warnings that come from experience rather than lectures. As the classes advance, though, we're getting into more complex aspects of the Java APIs and I'm getting stretched -- in the good way. I'm enjoying it a lot.

Aforementioned cute girl in the second row smokes like a chimney.
