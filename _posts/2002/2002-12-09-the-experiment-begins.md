So, Benson and Jenna and Decker and I are giving this 'vegetarian' thing a shot for a week. Those who know me understand that my swearing off meat is a bit like Robert Downey Jr. promising to lay off the smack. I'm a steakatarian by nature.

But it hasn't been too difficult so far. Lunch was tricky, with a limited number of veggie-friendly choices at the deli we were grabbing stuff from. A grilled cheese sandwich, breaded mushrooms, and yummy baklava all helped smooth the transition. Perhaps this won't be too bad...
