There once was a lassie named Fronczak
Who loved guacamole for her snack
When she played her guitar
Like a snazzy rock star
Of talent there was certainly no lack

Spent the evening hanging out with Jenn and the family she's staying with, celebrating her birthday and the birthday of Angela, the 16 year old daughter of said family. Cool people, the lot of them, and it was altogether a blast.

Mongolian grill, stir fry with attitude, and tipping the chefs to have the whole resturant  sing happy birthday to Jenn. Hah. She was close to killing us. I burnt up a year of good Karma participating in *that* affair.
