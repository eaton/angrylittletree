Over the last few months, <A HREF="http://news.com.com">CNET</A> has been going downhill faster than a six year old on a saucer sled. Never a bastion of journalistic integrity, it's long been seen as a Ziff-Davis funded platform for Pro-Status-Quo industry posturing. Lately, though, it's been even worse.
