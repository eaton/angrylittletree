Random thoughts: Proof of concept apps are *not* finished products. A web site that 'works' isn't a web site that's done. Have you put all the final data into the backend DB? Does the site keep working if the user enters an invalid product number? Did you leave in database constraints that would invalidate the production data? Does your catalog *break* if you try to bring up the main page once production data is in place?

Did you write a bunch of functions that *clobber each other* when you actually try to *run pages that call two of them at once?*

Sigh.

Sigh sigh.

I love working with other peoples' "almost finished" code.

In other news, I went out to catch a movie with the rest of the graceland crew after Axis tonight. We had a couple of heated discussions about movies (Consensus: <i>Pretty In Pink</i>, <i>The Shawshank Redeption</i>, and <i>Dead Poets Society</i> rocked. Disputed: My assertation that <i>Bed Of Roses</i> is not in fact romantic but instead is a creepy picture of a stalker getting the girl in the end.)

After steak and shaking, we went to AMC 30, the Biggest Darn Theater You Ever Did See and saw <i>Sam I Am.</i> Quick summary -- Sean Penn plays the developmentally disabled father of a young girl whose mother ditches after the birth. Despite having the mental and emotional faculties of a 7-year-old, he raises her and loves the crap outta her. As she gets older, though -- 4 or 5 -- the strain starts to show, and more and more problems come to the surface. After a series of nasty incidents, DCFS takes her away, and puts her in a foster home. The rest of the movie revolves around the growth of a couple key characters, and his legal fight to get custody back.

It's... an emotionally wrenching film, to say the least. It's been a long time since I was *afraid* to emotionally connect with a character on screen, for fear that it would turn out badly for them. It presented a lot of difficulties, and no easy 'villains' -- everyone had a a 7 year old girl's best interests at heart. Even as social workers tore the kid from her father's arms, with her crying, kicking and screaming, they were trying to get her out of what they saw as a dangerous situation long-term: a child being raised by someone without the ability to care for her or equip her for the world in a number of important ways.

It isn't all so depressing, I'll say that for anyone who's considering. I will say they managed to tell a story without nedless concessions to sex appeal, 'love overcomes everything' cliches, or shallow 'The simplest one teaches everyone a lesson' moralizing. It's just a complex, emotionally gripping story told very very well. Sean Penn is great and the supporting cast was excellent as well.

So yeah, I was near tears by the end of the film. It was just plain good.

I found myself more tense watching this film than I am with any given suspense/horror/action movie. Emotional investment is like that. You fear the worst, and you're afraid to hope for a happy ending. Even moreso because you're not sure what the happy ending would BE in this film.

But I did like it. The ending, that is -- and it's not what you expect.

It was good stuff.

I'm going to go now, and watch Mad Max to relax.
