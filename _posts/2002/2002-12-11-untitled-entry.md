Last night's official funny moment:

Me: So, Dana, today was pretty stressful, eh?
Dana: Oh, yeah. I definitely needed to blow off steam.
Me: You should play Unreal Tournament 2003 with Benson.
Dana: Mmm? Nah, I'm not really into those.
Me: Let me rephrase. You can chase your boyfriend around with a rocketlauncher and a railgun.
Dana: Ooooooooooohhhh...  [Pause] Honey! Jeff says I can chase you around with a rocket launcher!

Let the fragging begin. Little does she know that Benson was the unrivaled god of all that was Unreal Tournament back in the Geneer days. Friendships were formed around the idea of <i>managing to kill him just once.</i> We were thrilled and terrified to see those words on our screens: "Machine has joined the game."

Soon, I'm sure, she will understand.

And I'll be there to point and laugh.

That's my job!

*grin*
