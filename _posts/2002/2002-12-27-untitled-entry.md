And now I'm safe at home and I'm watching the first season of Mad About You on DVD.

And I have root beer.

Yeah, life is good.

Mad About You is actually one of my favorite series of the past decade or so... moreso than the snarkier stuff like The Simpsons and The Tick. It's one of the only pictures of a happily married young couple on network television; everything else has been driven by Will They/Won't They sexual tension, a running 'Wow, isn't suburbia hell?' joke, the 'Nuclear Families Are Never Healthy' assumption, or some other wink-wink nudge-nudge concession to jaded cynics.

Mad About You was just a sweet, funny show about two neurotic people who loved each other, and even liked each other.

Yay.
