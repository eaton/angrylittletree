I used to pretend when I was a kid. I remember being something like four or five years old and using a crappy little fisher price cassette recorder to tell stories to myself about being a superhero. rescuing people. having a girlfriend. what kind of screwed up kid thinks about that when he's five? me, apparently.

i remember whispering into the little three-slot condenser mike so no one would hear me, smelling the molded plastic and listening to the tape heads squeak around, recording. i knew it was stupid, even at 5, and i didn't want anyone to know i wanted to be a hero. how do we know what to be ashamed of, what dreams we can't tell anyone about, before we're old enough to ride a roller coaster?

i've got the sub cranked, and remixes of bush playing. their original stuff sucks for the most part, but hell, you get phili steir to remix something and it's gonna smoke no matter what kind of schlock it was to begin with.

that's how i self medicate these days.

people ask why i've got a collection with something like 500, 600 discs. why i've got an 80gig file server dedicated to mp3s. i figure that everyone's affected by music emotionally -- that's half the reason the AV1611 wackos freak out about the evils of pop music and stuff like that. me? i just know that i feel music, really intense. it can pull me up or slam me down or crank me up like a spring before i let loose.

so yeah, i use it a lot.

i've got mixes for every mood. stuff i can slap in when i'm numb and click the sub on and feel it fill me up. feel it tighten the numb, the emotional exhaustion, and squeeze it into a weird kind of energy, crank me up until i can work up some momentum and start going again.

or stuff that just, inexplicably, puts a huge come-get-some-punk grin on my face. usually that's the stuff with lots of 303's.

or stuff that just soaks with regret. vigilantes of love are good like that. put them on and let the music crack open the angst and just <i>feel</i> it for a while.

just rambling now i guess -- but yeah, me and music, we're like <b>this.</b>
