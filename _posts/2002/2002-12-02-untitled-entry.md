You have great love for others and will do just about anything to show it to them. You are tolerant 
and avoid confrontations, so people generally are drawn to you. You are more quiet and reserved in 
front of strangers, but around some people you open up. When things get tough, you like to meditate 
alone. Unfortunately you often get things like "what a pansy," or "you're such a liberal."<br></font>
