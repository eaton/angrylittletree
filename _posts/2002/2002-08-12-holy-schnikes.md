Several points:

<a href="http://www.csharphelp.com/archives2/archive297.html" target="_blank">Automatic Garbage Collection</a> is the shiznatz. Also the shiznatz is polymorphism.

<a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilm/product/film_multimedia/0,4470,2421835,00.html" target="_blank">XXX is an awesome film,</a> worthy of many thumbs up. Any film that concludes with a CGI rendered 3-minute long tribute to GnR album covers must be applauded.

<a href="http://www.heartless-bitches.com/rants/niceguys/predicate.shtml" target="_blank">Heartless Bitches.com</a> has printed something I wrote. I am strangely gratified.

<a href="http://bventertainment.go.com/movies/signs/index.html" target="_blank">Signs is, also, a film worthy of approval.</a>

<a href="http://www.geocities.com/lyricsworld_01/aqua_cdaquarium.htm" target="_blank">'Aquarium' by Aqua</a> is an evil, evil, evil CD. It is evil in the same fashoi nthat 'Blue' by Eiffel 65 is evil. IT'S ALL HOOK. That can't be right!

Thank you. That is all.
