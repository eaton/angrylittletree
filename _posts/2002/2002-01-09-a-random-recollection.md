Went to my church small group last night and had a good time catching up with people again; we played <A HREF="http://www.playcranium.com">Cranium</a> and started poking at the Beattitudes, which was interesting. Scott, the leader of my small group, is a pretty cool guy with a different angle of approach to most Biblical stuff. It matches mine really well ,and it's refreshing to see the way he looks at a lot of passages that get glossed over. Searching for the context, digging for intent... it's refreshing stuff, and he's appropriately witty and sarcastic while he's at it. *grin*

A random thought hit me as we were grabbing drinks; Diet Coca Cola is permanently fixed in my mind as the taste of kisses.
