So i've been horrendously lax in updating my LJ, haven't I? I have. I know. I'm terrible.

This week/weekend has been pretty cool. Thursday, Jen and I saw a high school version of Annie that some of her HS group kiddos were starring in. Oodles of fun, that -- the musical numbers were good and now I'm obsessed with seeing a big beat cover of It's A Hard Knock Life become reality. Awww yeah, cover songs!

They even survived the horrible collapse of a set during one of the songs, and an uncooperative dog playing the part of Sandy. During the climactic Annie-Inspires-Roosevelt-And-Creates-The-New-Deal sequence, everyone was supposed to wave a little paper flag they were given at the start of the show. Jen and I apparently deal with schmaltz in different ways -- She, being the nonconformist, refused to touch the flag. Me, being the ironic loon, waved it vigorously as if it was the Very Thing I'd Always Wanted To Do Since I Was A Little Boy. I finally had to pry her fingers open, put the flag in her hand, and forcibly waver her arm about. She took it like a trooper -- then perked up and started doing it on her own once I pointed out that the flags were made in China.

"Communist flags! Our friend China comes through again! Hah!" *wave wave wave wave*

I still want that cover song.

In less amusing news I owe oodles of dollars in taxes thanks to the combination of freelancing and so on that started off the year. Ah, well. I don't like being broke but it's better than being a couple grand in debt. ;) Zero is always better than a negative number!

Happier: Learning C#. I so love the System.Net libraries. Yummy.

And this evening... the graceland crew and I shall watch movies. Yummy.

And finally, in the So Twisted It Rocks category, <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/death_to_smoochy.html">Death To Smoochy,</A> starring Ed Norton and Robin Williams.
