i'm feeling less and less able to capture the flavor of the day's events -- perhaps it's because i wait until i'm totall chewed up by the day to write anything here. sigh! i wish the laptop would start working.

at work, kirkby & associates has the ball at the moment -- i'm waiting for word back from them on a number of things about the site. i rewrote portions of the trackone manual after feedback from dave, and feel that it's a lot stronger -- hopefully fred grenning will agree. he's the type of guy who will wait 4 months with no progress on something, then call you to start the job and explain that you're holding him up if you don't have it back within a day. he's a nice guy, just doesn't like implementation taking longer than brainstorming.

alison and i talked. i guess i should explain what happened, exactly. the cause behind my self-abusive outburst. she asked where she stood, in not so many words... an honest question that merited an honest answer: i don't know. unfortunately, that's not the kind of answer that helps anyone. after a few conversations and some confused rambling, she was hurt though she didn't want to be...we parted awkwardly and my increasing anger was focused inward. on my inability to be swept away by emotion. on my ability to /have/ emotions. feelings towards her. on... on... i don't know, really. but i felt like lashing out, and I was the only good target.

i think that it's better, now -- we have talked a bit more, and she says that she will not try to press anything anymore. ("But if you do become open to something, in the future, well, don't hesitate to speak up, you know.") She smiled afterwards, and I think that she is okay. I pray she is. She deserves someone who isn't confused.

drove over to jason's, relishing the strangeness of an unhampered drive. ("Hm. this is MY car. mom and dad have THEIR car. and THEIR car is back home. I don't have to worry about it. How... odd.") we taco bell'd and planned to get together tomorrow night. it was good, with much laughter and coining of new terms. ("That sucks mouse heads, man.")

must write. must continue writing. i depress myself with my inability to follow through. sigh. :/
