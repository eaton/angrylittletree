So after a chain of polls and quizzes posted, i thought I'd show some actual content. I poked around my hard drive and discovered some old stuff I'd written years back, whipped it into shape, and created <A HREF="http://www.dancingmongoose.com">www.dancingmongoose.com</A>... It's not strictly autobiographical; those who know me will recognize the whole middle-section as a complete fabrication. Never went to college, never got into a fight with my dad about Zork, those sorts of things.

But the beginning and the end... all true. And the vibe, that's right. It captures, at least to some extent, what got me hooked on text in the first place. Difficult to explain, but... hopefully it makes for an interesting read. More to come, maybe.
