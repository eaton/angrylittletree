Before I start my post proper, the obligatory news links: <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20020817-704732.htm" target="_blank">NASA researchers want to create a mind-reading security scanner</a>, and <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1017-952165.html?tag=fd_top" target="_blank">AOL scrambles for more ways to lure Joe Average</a>.

Long week. Veddy long week.

<lj-cut text="Where shall we start?">

The Intro to Java class that I've been taking since the beginning of summer has been going really well. This was the last week of full lectures and labs: starting monday, it's final exams and turning in projects. In the haze of work related frustrations, this has been a serious boost, strangely enough. The fact that the material comes pretty easy to me helps in some ways -- somewhat less frustration, etc. A big thing though is the opportunity to learn new things, solve conceptual problems...

One of the things I've enjoyed a lot about it is the confirmation, the encouragement that I've been learning the right lessons over the last couple years as a software developer. I never went to college, was never 'trained' or educated in a formal sense, so I've picked up everything I know about programming on my own. A book here, a book there, studying peoples' source code, trying things on my own and seeing the results... Then, working on larger projects professionally and learning lessons the hard way. ("What? Load testing? DOH!")

Now that I'm taking the first steps into actual 'education' I'm realizing that I've learned a lot of the really, really hard lessons that come only from experience. I'm hardly a weathered old hand, only a wet behind the ears dev with a few years under his belt. But I look at problems with the weight of good, solid real world experience behind me. And the techniques I've picked up are, to some extent, the ones that survive and work in-the-trenches with  teams of devs trying to ship product, not just students trying to make a grade.

It reminds me of <a href="http://www.predicate.net/quality.asp" target="_blank">a chapter from Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a>, where Phaedrus teaches his students to recoqnize Quality in writing by reading, reading, reading, writing, writing, writing, then judging without understanding the 'rules.' After months of 'playing by ear' they begin to define things that make writing succeed or fail and -- then, only then -- do they truly understand the importance and beauty of the rules of English.

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Now, at last, the standard rhetoric texts came into their own. The principles expounded in them were no longer rules to rebel against, not ultimates in themselves, but just techniques, gimmicks, for producing what really counted and stood independently of the techniques...Quality. What had started out as a heresy from traditional rhetoric turned into a beautiful introduction to it.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

I feel as if that's how I've learned about concepts like OOP, error handling, code reuse, care in defining specifications, information hiding, and so on. I've learned the problems, played with solutions, and now -- being told the 'right' ways of doing X, or Y, the rules seem beautiful. They're solutions, not rules.

Work, on the other hand, has been an exercise in frustration. The client owes me over $6000 at this point, and wrangling over 'pay by the hour as we go' versus 'pay when the project is completed' has left me scraping together pocket change and pricing my book collection on eBay to keep bills paid. If the project had been completed on time, my client says, it wouldn't be an issue -- but the project has become progressively more complex with each passing week, and I wasn't privy to the original time estimates.

So, it's a rock/hard place situation. If I bail, I don't get any of it. If I keep working, it gets more complex and drags on longer. The end is (hopefully) in sight soon, though. I just hope that the client is good for the full amount; he's been touchy about how much the project has run over the original estimates. ("Er, if you would stop changing the specs of the billing system every two days, that would definitely help...")

Other random events [relationally-oriented things. friends? see private post for details. yeah.] also got me down, into a bit of a gunky, spiraling funk as I contemplated my future and my life. Lonliness reared its ugly head. Cynicism made a brief cameo, but was ushered out by the regular, Existential Dread and his partner Hopelessness.

I'm a sap, aren't I? Terrible. I need to grow some balls and stop going into a depressive spiral when someone I really like [Read: am interested in attempting to start a relationship with, perhaps] is not interested. I take it as a stinging prophecy of my future lonliness and isolation. If someone I respect and dig thinks I'm not worth having a relationship with, why would anyone else? Awk! Cue panic and dread.

But it shouldn't be like that, not really. It's like that old Russian folk tale: an old man is given a horse, and his neighbors celebarate for him, saying it's a wonderful thing. He says, "It might be good... it might be bad. We wait and we see!" The horse kicks his son, breaking the son's leg: neighbors wail and lament the terrible coming of the horse. The old man repeats his statement:  "It might be good... it might be bad. We wait and we see!" Then, a week later, the Czar declares war and the village's young men are drafted, sure to die in a hopeless battle. But the old man's son, injured, is left home and lives. You can see the rest of this one coming, can't you? The jist of it is, I shouldn't freak out at the short term stuff. Trust God. not that he has a particular outcome planned, but rather that He knows what He is doing, regardless of the outcome. Do what I can, don't be stupid, love people, listen to His guidance and keep cool.

Yeah. That.

If only my heart were as smart as my head.
