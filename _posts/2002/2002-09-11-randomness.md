my two hours of commuting per day gives me lots of time to listen to really, really bad radio pop music. One song that gets a freakishly high level of airplay, given how much it sucks, is Amber's <I>Need to be naked</I>. Now, let's get something straight. Naked is fine with me, I've got nothing against it. And songs about people who want to  get jiggy, well, they're all over the place. This song, though, reaches new levels of stupidity. For your amusement, I shall deconstruct it, MST3K style.


<b><i>The Need To Be Naked</i></b>
Tom Servo: A drama, in three acts...
Crow: Finally, music for the under-represented naturalist demographic!
Joel: Boys, boys...


 <i><b>I feel the need to be naked with you 
I feel the need to be naked with you 
Need to be naked with you</b></i>
Tom Servo: Heyyy, wait a minute...
Joel: Crow, you might want to turn away now...
Crow: What? What? I don't get it!

<b><I>How can I explain the forces of nature
Why do opposites attract
Aren't we just animals after all at night when the sky is black </I></b>
Tom Servo: [falsetto] I don't understand, Jimmy! The sun goes down, and I just turn into an animal!
Crow: Excuse me, Ma'am, are you sensitive to garlic? Wolfsbane perhaps?
Joel: I think she's talking about...

<B><I>I want you so bad, this craziest feeling that I ever had 
I feel the need to be naked with you (need to be naked with you) 
I feel the need to be naked with you (need to be naked with you)</I></B>
Tom Servo: Woooah there, Nellie...
Joel: Will you still love me in the morning?
Crow: You know what Baptists say about this kind of thing...


<i><b>Take off my pants, my shirt, my socks and my shoes</b></i> 
Crow: Hey, guys, check it out! Amber wears socks over her *shoes!*
Tom Servo: This is the sort of confusion that's usually cleared up by the first or second grade, isn't it?
Joel: Don't be cruel, Tom, she might have been home schooled...

<i><b>I need to be naked with you 
I need to be naked with you 

All these clothes just come between us</b></i>
Tom Servo: Well, yes, that is what they tend to do, dear.
Joel: [singing] The touch... the feel... of cotton... 
Crow: [harmonizing] ...The fabric of our lives...


<b><i>Let's go where no one can see us 
My skin, my lips need to lick your fingertips</i></b>
Tom Servo: Why, what a coincidence! My skin needs to lick YOU, too!
Crow: Tom, Tom, Tom... you have so little sympathy for the burden of rhyme that artists suffer under!
Joel: Crow, that doesn't rhyme.


<b><i>Take off my pants, my shirt, my socks and my shoes</i></b> 
Crow: See! Look! There it is again!
Joel: Well, she's always been ahead of the fashion curve...

[fade to black as Jeff gets too tired to continue mocking]

and speaking of fashion, I got new pants and a sweater. Yay.

Am I being dumb and trendy for shopping at Old Navy? It's not a fashion decision really. I just like long sleeved light sweaters with stripedy things.

the end.
