Hmm.

So I posted a while back about how amazingly shilly news.com has been, with all sorts of silly corporate apologist articles and love letters to spam. I was shocked today to find <A HREF="http://news.com.com/2010-1078-941412.html">a balanced, reasonable, articulate article</a> on digital rights management that perfectly summed up the need for a sea-change in the entertainment industry.

Kudos, CNet.
