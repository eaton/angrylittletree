Watching the Star Wars Episode II trailer is like taking a phone call from an abusive ex. You know it'll be painful, but... but... you have <i>history</i> together.

So regardless of how much Episode I sucked, I had to watch the new trailer. I caught the Fox Network broadcast of it, sandwiched between the X-Files and some other show... I'm conflicted. Lucas is obviously leveraging the fact that <A HREF="http://www.theforce.net/">an entire generation of geeks</A> have a genetic dependency onf Star Wars media. I mean, we're the ones who made <A HREF="http://www.teleport-city.com/movies/reviews/bizarro/starwars.html">A Very Wookie Christmas</A> a television success, for crying out loud.

So I watched. And the <A HREF="http://bigyellowbox.tripod.com/">light saber fights</A> were cool. And Jango Fett rocked. And the <A HREF="http://www.lightsabersinc.8m.com/lightsab.htm">light saber fights</A> were REALLY cool. And it has Ewan. And yeah, there's two-blade <A HREF="http://www.darthsworkshop.fsnet.co.uk/SW_index.htm">light saber fighting</A>... So that's cool...

You'll notice I'm trying not to mention the acting.

<A HREF="http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2001-04-18&res=l">Or the digital everything.</A>

Or the acting.

And then there's the acting.

By the time it finished I felt like I was watching the <A HREF="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~rjh9u/hbmut.html">mutant offspring</A> of <A HREF="http://www.nando.net/technology/story/236383p-2261054c.html">Final Fantasy</A> and <A HREF="http://www.filmsite.org/whof.html">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</A> star in its first high school play. I don't think there's an actual physical set in the entire trailer -- just actors jogging through epic <A HREF="http://www.playcenter.com/PC_Games/Reviews/Emperor_Battle_for_Dune_reviews.htm">CGI battles</A> and jumping into endless <A HREF="http://www.scea.com/games/categories/racing/kinetica/">CGI chasms</A> and flying through <A HREF="http://www.surfnetkids.com/games/asteroids-game.htm">CGI asteroid fields</A> and generally doing lots of <A HREF="http://howstuffworks.lycos.com/blue-screen2.htm">jumping about in front of blue screens</A>.

So of course I went and <A HREF="http://starwars.apple.com/ep2/clone_war/index.html">downloaded the Quicktime version</A>.

*sob*

OK, George. I give. <A HREF="http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2002-02-04&res=l">You my daddy.</A>

I feel so dirty now.
