So I'm no good at hiatuses. Is that a crime?

Good news of the day: I've had a blast with the small group lately, and Jeff B and I managed to survive a stint running the show while Scott (the normal leader) is out of town. Dana, the Resident <A HREF="http://phd.stanford.edu/archive.cfm?comicid=272">Troublemaker And Conspiratorial Female</A> of the group, has roped Jeff B into a terrible bet that will culminate in a heavily-documented manicure. I was brought in as an outside consultant, thanks to my talent for <A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/intercal/">Evil Scheming And Plotting</A>, and I've managed to put together a concept that will constitute a proper <A HREF="http://www.theonion.com/onion3646/ping_pong_playing_man.html">warning shot over the bow of the Ship Of Feminine Wiles</A>. Blackmail, custom printed T-shirts, digital cameras, Photoshop, and 8x10 glossies of Fabio are involved. No <A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=neurotic+meerkat">fuzzy creatures</A> will be harmed during the completion of this hack.

In other news, Jenn is proving to be quite the kickin' carpool companion. She even managed to survive meeting the gang when we headed downtown saturday. if someone survives 10 minutes of mock british and a full rendition of the praying mantis song as their introduction, they've *earned* my respect.

<A HREF="http://www.goats.com/comix/0104/goats010413.gif">Work continues on the freelance projects.</A> I have determined that I do not like anyone else's code unless they are Jeff B, Lou Skriba, Dave Lee, or Adam. Others may qualify, but they have not yet been discovered. (Any previous members of the GPDA team are automatically included on this list.)

And speaking of the RIAA, my epic <A HREF="http://www.goats.com/comix/0006/goats000602.gif">Make The World's Coolest Homebrew Jukebox</A> project is plugging along. I've ripped about half of my CD collection, which ammounts to 250-300 CDs, 3000+ songs, 20+ gigs of disk space, and over 10 days of music. It's the shuffle play of DHOOOM. I also found scary music lurking in my collection. <A HREF="http://www.guidetopetra.com/album.html?num=10">I deny all knowledge of its origins.</A>
