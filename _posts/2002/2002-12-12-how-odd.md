It's strange how memories work, and how connected they are to sensations, to tastes, smells, sounds. I can talk about my long-ended relationship with my ex all I want to, and it's in the past. But if I accidentally grab a can of diet Coke instead of classic? That year comes back like instant replay. She drank copious quantities of Diet Coke, see, and every time we kissed, I tasted it. It wasn't until after we broke up that I realized the connection; to this day, I can't have a diet coke without intense memories flooding back.

Weird.

So yeah, I need to be more careful when I punch the button on the soda machine here at work.
