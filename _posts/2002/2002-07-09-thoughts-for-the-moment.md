Mmmm, ultimate frisbee with the graceland crew. Yay! About a dozen or so of us met up in the park and ran ourselves ragged... our team lost, mainly because it took us a couple of lost poitns to realize that short relay passes are the way to go, NOT long bombs. 

First Observation: I'm better on defense than offense. Rachel disliked me severely while we were playing for the guarding. Then again, she's the one who tried to say that it was perfectly legal to grab my hands and wrestle me away from Scott when he was trying to pass the frisbee. Interference! Interference!

Second Observation: Oh Lord, I'm so not in shape. I just about died. Pain. Pain is me. Ow. So much sprinting and running and blocking and jumping and oh my an hour and a half and heat. I survived by pouring bottled water over myself. I'd rather look like a wet cat (and a geeky cat at that) than collapse.

It was oodles of fun, though, and we made a good showing once we figured out how to march a drive down the field.

Afterwards, we all drifted over to Oberweis for shakes/soda/ice cream/etc. Not much to say at the moment, I'm just tuckered in the good way.
