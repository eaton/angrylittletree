After accusations of attempted-hotness, I would like to clarify my position on The Webcam Issue.

Contrary to the opinion of a small but vocal minority, I am not in fact 'trying to look hot.' I am in fact marveling at the niftiness of low-cost CMOS sensor arrays and the camera assemblies made possible by the widespread availability of same.

Geeky is fun.

Yay!

Thank you for your time.
