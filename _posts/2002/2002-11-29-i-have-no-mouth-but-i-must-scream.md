So this evening I sat down with the family to watch a nice movie they'd picked out. The Straight Story. It's a Disney flick. It's a slow-paced piece about an elderly man who drives a riding lawn mower from Iowa to Wisconsin. It's a subtle movie with some nuanced acting. Based on a true story.

DIRECTED BY DAVID LYNCH.

What? What the?

The man who brought backwards-talking midgets, cross-dressing special agents, and strangled beauty queens to prime time television? David Twin Peaks Mulholland Drive Lynch?

I'm sorry. Give me a moment. I'll be fine...
