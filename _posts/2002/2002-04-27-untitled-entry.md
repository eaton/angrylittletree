so jason and i are talking and trading loops and he gives me the link to his webcam page. and i'm grinning, because it's amazing how much of a difference it makes seeing *feedback* -- you know. watching someone grin when you say something, or grimace when they hear a bad section of the loop.

so i grabbed my old camcordre, routed all port 88 traffic to my mac, and rigged up video capture software on it. <A HREF="http://65.184.200.157:88/">sometimes, a webcam is just the right thing to do.</A>

man.

i really need to stop slouching so much...
