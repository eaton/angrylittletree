Random link of the moment: <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,51270,00.html">Fidel bans computer sales to the Cuban public</A>... a sad, sad move. But on to the weekend - it was good. A little scattered and hectic, but otherwise... tres spiff.

<A HREF="http://www.predicate.org/fresh/payphone_sharp.jpg"><img src="/files/lj-photos/fresh/payphone_sharp.jpg" HEIGHT="160" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1"></A>Friday, worked on the basics of the VB6 app I'm writing for a company in Schaumburg. Nothing big, just a quick one-off utility that'll automate a Citrix application. It's somewhat evil, as it's all remote-control a la PCAnywhere, so I have to do bitmap matching to figure out if windows are ready for input, and fun stuff like that. Rar!

In the process I've reacquainted myself with Win32 API calls in VB6, and I'm working with onscreen graphics for the first time in my life. I'm used to straight data structures and algorithms, none of this funky *BITMAP* stuff.

Lateish friday evening, hung out with Fur and Danny and Bren and drooled over cool palmpilot apps, supped at Denny's, etc etc. Unfortunately Fur had work in the morning so late-late-late-ish activities and all night movie bashes were not much of an option.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<A HREF="http://www.predicate.org/fresh/stained_glass.jpg"><img src="/files/lj-photos/fresh/stained_glass.jpg" HEIGHT="160" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1"></A>Saturday morning, more coding, and some research into the joy of the GDI APIs. You'd think that <i>someone</i> out there would've created a COM object that can compare two bitmaps, but noooo... After some phone tag with Jen, I headed out into the city to hang out with her and a friend of hers from college -- now married and visiting from Nabraska. We drove about and bantered and took photos and generally amused ourself while Jen's Friend's Hubby griped about traffic.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<A HREF="http://www.predicate.org/fresh/caution.jpg"><img src="/files/lj-photos/fresh/caution.jpg" HEIGHT="160" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1"></A>It was a little surreal and unsettling at times -- he's a pretty blunt person, and although he seems to care about his wife and love her, he says genuinely cruel and mean things all the time, with a sort of joking jovial tone that implies they're all in good fun. Regardless, things like 'I make the money, you spend it, don't complain...' 'Don't be stupid, I'm right and you know it...' and things like that... I can't conceive of those comments being <i>positive</i> in any way. It's just kind of weird. I'm not about to get into a discussion with someone I don't know about the inappropriateness of negative gender stereotypes and so on in a marriage, but still.

It's not even in the same league as Assman's ranting and frothing, obviously -- it's just... a certain casual belittling. I wish I could articulate better what I mean, but I think it boils down to this: There is no true conflict between honesty and respect. If you love someone, you'll have both.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<A HREF="http://www.predicate.org/fresh/alley.jpg"><img src="/files/lj-photos/fresh/alley.jpg" HEIGHT="160" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1"></A>Anyhow, we had dinner at a little mexican place (three cheers for bottled pineapple juice, hooray for good steak fajitas!) and more of Jen's college friends joined the crew. I got a bit of an inside look at a Christian college, which was funky, and we did the socialization thing for a while. Jen seemed a little off balance when she asked me how I was doing -- I think she's not used to me being quiet. Heh. When I actually shut up for a while, apparently it's spooky. In actuality, I was enjoying myself a lot -- and trying not to argue with the guy when he made statements like, "It's impossible for men and women to be friends. A guy always wants something from her." It was good for me.

Quote of the night:

Him: "I'm an expert complainer. Seriously. Give me anything and I can complain about it!"
Me: "Free beer?"
Him: [long pause] "It's probably Busch Light!"

We watched Billy Madison in a cramped studio apartment, then trundled back to her friends' hotel. Valet parking, while slightly more expensive than finding an open space on the street, offers one major advantage: you know you won't be towed. Mmmmm, blessed relaxation! By the time I dropped her off and got myself back home, it was near 4am. Arrrr. Sweet blessed unconsciousness!<BR CLEAR=ALL>

There's a series of dubbed Hong Kong action flicks playing each week at the Gene Siskel Film Center -- same price as a regular theater, but startlingly stylish and upscale. You poke into a little street-level entrance on the gold coast, climb up a few flights of stairs, and find yourself in a euro-trendy cafe, brightly lit with off-white decor and stylish designer chairs.

It's the only place I've ever heard someone make a witty Tennyson reference while waiting in line for jujubees.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<A HREF="http://www.predicate.org/fresh/el.jpg"><img src="/files/lj-photos/fresh/el.jpg" HEIGHT="160" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" BORDER="1"></A>Post-movie we caught up, traded Scary Friend Stories ("So his ex-girlfriend drove over his new girlfriend with a truck, and <i>he was so moved, he broke up with the new girl and married his ex!"</i>), and discussed the potential for ePirate, a workflow automation program for pirates. Jeff Benson and I originally came up with the idea -- a program that would combine business workflow automation with helpful wizards to bring seafaring barbarism into the 21st century. "It looks like you're trying to raid a small coastal village," says Clippy The Pirate. "Would you like me to help?"

You know you want it.<BR CLEAR=ALL>
