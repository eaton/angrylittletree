<BLOCKQUOTE>
Guess what... you've got a secret admirer!

Want to find out who it is? Just click to http://www.CrushLink.com

Email address: jce@predicate.net
Invitation code: h69rgt 

Make sure you enter in this information exactly as shown above.

See you soon!

Sincerely,

PS. This is not junk email. You've received it because someone you know came to CrushLink and confessed an interest in you! Maybe it was that hottie from English class or the cute one at the party last weekend or maybe--well, we can't even give you a hint until you come to CrushLink.com.
