Guys who say stupid things to women, even joking, piss me off. AA bunch of us were hanging around tonight and horsing around, tossing around afootball while talking. One of the guys made a crack about one of the women I know being 'built like a man' in the context of the sports conversation. It was obviously just an off the cuff comment, and he didn't mean anything by it (blatantly untrue, too, since I very rarely met guys with curvy figures, long brown hair, breasts).

But accuracy and intent aside, it pisses me off that someone would even *say* it. I mean, clearly, girls deal with enough cultural crap about appearances and enough self image baggage. What good is one by saying cutting things like that just for the heck of it? You can apologize but the words stick.

I'm not trying to score Gender Points brinigng it up, or anything like that -- I mean, obviously women do the same thing. I've been the brunt of enough jokes from female friends about how nice it is to have a gay friend, or how I'm built like a skeleton instead of a jock, that I stopped caring and just tell the jokes myself.

But it pisses me off, deeply, seeingthe same thing done to someone else. I think I'll just repeat that fact a few times. I talked to her a little about it later and she handled it pretty well (I think the guy feared for his life after realizing what he'd said, whihc I was gratified by).

Yuck.

People Suck.

That's all, good night.
