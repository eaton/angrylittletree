<A HREF="http://lonestar.texas.net/~dub/sterling.html">Bruce Sterling</A> has always been one of my favorite authors from the cyberpunk crowd. He <A HREF="http://www.io.com/~ftp/usr/shiva/SMOF-BBS/cheap.truth/">helped kick the genre off</A>, but he never got sucked into the myopic <A HREF="http://www.qmw.ac.uk/~english/cbl/project/taz/cpunk.htm">Hipper Than Thou</A> contests that infect any 'artsy' genre. Earlier this month he wrote <A HREF="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2002-03-01/screens_feature2.html">an article for the Austin Chronicle</A> pontificating about new digital culture. It's not <i>news</i> to anyone who follows bleeding edge, but it's cool insightful, and full of great pull quotes.

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>The core demographic at SXSW is the woolly-eyed digital creative, a species of creature from way before the Boom. Those characters were never anywhere near the big IPOs. They were all fueled by sheer subcultural coolness.</I>
