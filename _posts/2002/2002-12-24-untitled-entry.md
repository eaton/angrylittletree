It's 1:15 AM, and it's still snowing. Who would've guessed? It'll be a white Christmas after all. Happy holidays, everyone -- I've been out of commission for a while but should be catching up over the next couple of days. It's been bad, it's been good, and it's been wacky.

To all my friends out there, thanks.

You're loved.
