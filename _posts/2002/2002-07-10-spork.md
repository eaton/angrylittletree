So while I've been sorting through various work related things, I've been neglecting my LJ terribly. I can't make up for lost time, but I <i>can</i> post fun and zany stuff that fills in some of the gaps, right?<br clear="all">
<b>The Java Schtuff</b>
<img src="/files/lj-photos/java.jpg" width=400 height=198 alt="Breakfast. Yum!" align="left" border="1">So, yeah -- I've been taking this Java course, and it's actually been a real blast so far. It's kind of like working for a client, except the professor actually gives you detailed func specs for the programs you're supposed to write instead of handing you a napkin with 'Not sure about features, must be done next week' scribbled on it. Of course, the downside is that you have to pay the school instead of being paid by the client, but I'm beginning to understand the appeal of academic life.

I think I've finished the midterm project, which was pretty fun -- totally academic exercise, no need to implement things like persistence, complicated UI, or anything like that. It was pretty elementary since I've already had programming (thouhg not Java) experience, so I ended up playing with it and coming up with a couple of cleaner solutions to the problem than the one that was explicitly spelled out in the assignment. Yay! Fun fun.

<b>The Camping Schtuff</b>

A couple of weeks back (Was it a couple? Man. It was only the 28th and 29th of June... Time flies...) we went out camping at the Indiana State Dunes. We being the Graceland crew... It was a great time, almost a dozen of us showed up and a good time was had by all. Notable near-disasters included visits from anal retentive forest rangers who insisted that we ewre 'Over the legal limit of tents per site,' which was odd since the troup of boyscouts next to us had more than we did. But hey, we're Rowdy Twentysomethings... you never know when we might cause trouble! Rachel charmed them with her feminine wiles (lots of smiles and lots of blinking and looking very very helplessly confused while asking if we might perhaps be able to stay anyhow...) and we got off without a hitch. Rah!

Nighttime brought forraging by fearless raccoons the size of overweight collies. The things <i>fought each ohter</i> for the right to raid our camp coolers. Chuck (the bald guy standing up in the photo above) had one of them scampering over his legs en rought to the picnic table. He pegged it with a bottle of OFF, and it didn't seem to bother him after that...

Joanna and Jenna and I played a smashing game of travel-scrabble into the wee hours of the night, which was a definite blast. We're such scrabble geeks. How can you not love it? Joanna won, being that she's a Decker (grrr) but Jenna and I gave her quite a fight getting there.

The aforementioned boyscouts woke us up at six, with clattering and pans and nuclear weapons and laughing and all sorts of things that made us very happy we'd brought along Valium to keep Dana from killing them slowly. (OK, no Valium, just her boyfriend holding her back while she muttered vile invectives. She's not a morning person...*grin*) We all trekked to the dunes proper around 10:00 and spent the rest of the day bopping around the beach, playing frisbee, and a few pickup games of volleyball. I suck for the most part (Shock!) but it was a lot of fun.
