Problems with the way the church talks about sex:

I'm guilty because I'm told it's wrong, but I'm told "it's wrong because you're guilty."

This is slight of hand. It's easier to appeal to circular emotions, but it answers no fundamental questions. It forces behavior without addressing the real questions and needs.

Why *should* I be guilty, and why shouldn't I?

Who am I as a sexual being? What do we believe the bible says about for relating in sexual and non-sexual ways?


What if people are happy having sex? Are we covering our ears and singing to avoid admitting that we believe God wants us to avoid things that are very pleasurable, bring people closer to each other, etc...?

It's easy to say "You know where the lines are..." Without actually explaining. If the Bible doesn't talk about oral sex, it's easy to roll your eyes and implying that someone is trying to justify behaviors. That doesn't answer the question, though. Why do we believe that it's a behavior that needs justifying?

Until we start looking at these questions and honestly engaging those who don't fit our scare tactic stereotypes, we as the church will never affect change in lives or culture.
