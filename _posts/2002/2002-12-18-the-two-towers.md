So tired. Caught the movie with <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a>, <a href="http://danaamor.livejournal.com">danaamor</a>, <a href="http://rdecker.livejournal.com">rdecker</a>, and <a href="http://gundi.livejournal.com">gundi</a>... As blaster said, it takes some time to absorb. To say it's a 'very different movie' would be a misstatement. More accurately, it's the middle of the story, not the beginning. It has to carry the weight of multiple simultaneous plot threads, weaving a series of related but separate events into a setup for the conclusion in the third film.

More analysis coming when I'm coherent, but I can say that it was a blast and seeing it with good friends is definitely the way to do it. I can't wait until 2004, when I'll be able to sit down with everybody and dedicate a weekend to a seamless viewing of all 3 extended-directors-omnibus-editions.
