The weekend, by the way, was pretty fun. Hilight was chilling with Jen and the rets of the graceland crew at a movie bash. Dana, my Potential Evil Arch Nemesis and GF of my other friend Jeff, always tries to make these events into Girls Versus Boys parties. Guys were subjected to Much Ado About Nothing, an excellent movie save the presence of Keanau Reeves. No costume drama should feature an actor from Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure greased up and wearing leather pants.

Ever.

We retaliated though, with Pitch Black. What an awesome, awesome scifithrilleraction flick. <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Diesel,+Vin">Vin Diesel</A> plays a <A HREF="http://www.upcomingmovies.com/pitchblack2.html">most excellent sociopath.</A>
