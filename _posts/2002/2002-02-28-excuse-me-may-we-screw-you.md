So I got a credit card offer in the mail today. Normally I just tear 'em up on principle and go about my business, but this one caught my eye. I mean, any company named 'Credicorp, Inc.' is certain to be reputable, right?

So... let me get this straight... I pay $30 a year for the right to buy $10,000 of shoddy merchandise directly from some fly by night company in southern Illinois that has no bank affiliations... and they'll tell me the details once I pony up.

Wow! Sign me up!
