random linkage of the night...

<A HREF="http://www.baen.com/library/palaver6.htm">an excellent rebuttal</A> to the 'free digital media hurts sales' ranting we hear from RIAA and publishers. It's the firsthand account of a scifi author whose sales have jumped 215% since he started giving away one of his books in PDF format.

<A HREF="http://www.msnbc.com/news/745696.asp">viral engineering</a> is being used to build nanoparts. yep. instead of trying to perfect little molecular sized pushers and nudgers, they're just engineering viruses that suck up, say, zync molecules and stick them into a specific structure. cool stuff, but scary, too. i guess if we can get used to fungus in our salad, we can get used to virii building our nanotech.

<a HREF="http://www.predicate.net/kannt/future_free.mp3">another attempt</A> at a mixed up song. i'm slowly but surely getting happier with my attempts. soon i might be making stuff tha tdoesn't utterly suck. this one uses a nice piano melody, drumes for gating, a synth briefly, a lot of samples, and a brief snappy drum loop for the second half. again, not very complex at all but i'm learning how to use the sequencer for more complicated compositions. whee. eh?

hung out yesterday with wumber, jason, breez, and jenn. saw spider man, caught up with jason, traded loops and samples in the ongoing mix collaboration. much fun. it was kind of a bummer to not be able to spend more time with jason; he's my best bud. but it's cool that he's getting a chance to hang out with breez and all that good stuff. tonight i hit the concert in aurora, and missed him playing for in the cosmetic set. afterwards, <a href="http://fur.livejournal.com">fur</a>, <a href="http://hiddenpixie.livejournal.com">hiddenpixie</a> and i hit walter payton's old <A HREF="http://www.epinions.com/content_11126607492">roundhouse grill.</A> what an exquisitely cool place! very posh. dad would probably flip over it, what with the old train connection...

but now i'm fading out fast. yay. time to sleep.
