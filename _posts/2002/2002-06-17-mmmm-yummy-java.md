Mmmm.

I'm posting from the first lecture of CS 217: Intro to Java Programming. You can tell the die-hard CS geeks, because as soon as they read the "NO GAMES, NO CHAT" signs on the lab computers, they hit the web and download Mah Jong.

<B>public class program1
{
     public static void main(String s[])
     {
     //Welcome to my first Java program.
     System.out.println("Check it, yo. I'm the shiznitz.");
     }
}
</B>

Mmmmm. Taste it.
