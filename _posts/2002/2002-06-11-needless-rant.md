Ranting about amateur poststructuralists follows. You have been warned!

<!--break-->

When, I ask you. When will freshman lit crit students and those who never left that stage of life realize that reading elaborate subtext theories into popular films is NOT witty, insightful, or profound? Hello. It's called recontextualization. The fact that you can argue persuasively that Spiderman is a film about wanking does NOT make you Derrida.

Yes, we realize that you have just discovered the profound and shocking idea that all male conflict is sublimated desire. This does not mean that the director of 'The Dirty Dozen' was creating a complex metaphorical retelling of stonewall.

The WHOLE POINT of the exercise is the destruction of inherent meaning and the exaltation of subjective interpretation. These discoveries are a commentary on YOU, not the writer, artist, director, or the art in question.

Thank you.

That is all.
