Fun things: Doing product shots and getting paid for it. Got an emergency call from <a href="http://www.robis.net">Robis</a>, one of the companies I work with. They needed close-ups of a product they're doing some brochures for, knew I had a high quality digital camera, and wondered if I could help. A few hours later, I'd taken a few dozen shots of assorted boxes, products, and so on from a zillion different angles. It was fun. Totally different from the software work I'm usually doing these days.

Last night was good, too -- went out and grabbed pizza with Leah, Elisa, Becks, and their friend Bill. Much back-and-forth banter, much laughter, and some TMI comments that should cause any guy to claw his ears out. C'est la vie. Whee! Tonight, if all goes well, we may go karaoke'ing. On the other hand, maybe that's what happens if things DON'T go well.

Leah gave me a Christmas present. Spinal Tap: The Special Edition DVD! I love it so. She's the bestest!
