once upon a time
there was a boy/girl
is he/she you?
do you want
your happy
ending?
choose tragedy or comedy
stories are our lenses
but
they're
all
cracked
up
the stories we tell each other
aren't myths or history
they're movies
romance
horror
heroism
so we cut and paste
editing
outlining
cramming memory
into plot and genre
to make story-sense
of the confusion
to find story-hope
we want our happy endings
so we play by story-rules
those things that
resonate
but
they're
all
blown
out
stretched and torn
feedback loops
and funhouse mirrors
old stories, new stories
torn from life
decoupled
like trains
without engines
and still we're here
tied to stories
twisted up and trying
to find the rhythm
and the words
trying
to
find
a
story
that fits
to find the story
that ends with happy ever after
