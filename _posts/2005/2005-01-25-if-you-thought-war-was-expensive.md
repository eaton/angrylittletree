...Wait 'til you see the price tag on peace.

OK, it's not really fair to characterize it that way. but the Melbourne Hearald Sun's headline this morning made me chuckle darkly. "Extra $80bn Required To Seek Peace":http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5478,12050614%255E401,00.html it says. It sort of implies that we've been seeking chaos and conflict until this very moment, when peace became the next objective. I'm not cynical enough to believe that's the truth, but the badly-worded headline will surely cause lots of snarky one-liners.

Er. Crap, I'm part of the problem!
