After a long stretch of trying to roll my own photo library (and a stab at doing it with Drupal's image gallery features) I decided the time was right, and jumped onto the Flickr train. My machine at home is currently busy uploading something like 450 megs of JPEG goodness. Once it's all done, my stuff should be viewable <A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70315202@N00/">on my Flickr homepage.</a>
