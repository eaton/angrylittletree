To say there are a few distressing trends in our country's political system is to engage in wild understatement. There's hyperpolarization, the collapse of diverse viewpoints to a single linear measurement, and the eventual reduction of <em>that</em> to a "with us or against us" boolean.



That latter is depressing when it infects public discourse. It's sad when it affects public policy, too. But a recent decision by the White House has taken it from 'sad' to 'scary.' They've decided to <em>exclude companies that supported Kerry from participating in telecommunications standards meetings.</em> Let this sink in. Every year the State Department puts together lists of companies who will help hammer out communications geekery for North and Central America. Traditionally, anyone with the expertise has been welcome. Now? If you're not a Bush backer, you're out of luck. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1053595,00.html">From Time magazine:</a>



<blockquote>The White House admits as much: "We wanted people who would represent the Administration positively, and--call us nutty--it seemed like those who wanted to kick this Administration out of town last November would have some difficulty doing that," says White House spokesman Trent Duffy. Those barred from the trip include employees of Qualcomm and Nokia, two of the largest telecom firms operating in the U.S., as well as Ibiquity, a digital-radio-technology company in Columbia, Md. One nixed participant, who has been to many of these telecom meetings and who wants to remain anonymous, gave just $250 to the Democratic Party. Says Nokia vice president Bill Plummer: "We do not view sending experts to international meetings on telecom issues to be a partisan matter. We would welcome clarification from the White House."</blockquote>



Using participation in government decision-making meetings as a carrot for supporters and a stick for the unfaithful is a grand tradition in politics. Most political machines do it -- The Democratic reign of Daley here in Chicago was a textbook case of how to throw weight around. But this? This isn't even about government power. It isn't even about choosing who will represent the administration... It's about selecting <em>representatives of the private sector</em> for an international standards meeting, not choosing political representatives for your administration. If the White House is cutting people out because they supported another candidate, they are abusing their power and sending a very clear message: if you want to play with the big boys of industry, you have to pick our side.



To see a sitting presidential administration admit that is scary. What <em>depresses</em> me is knowing how many people will defend it as a good idea.
