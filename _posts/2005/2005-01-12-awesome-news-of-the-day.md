First, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005JN8S/104-9728992-8434331?v=glance&s=dvd" target="_blank">Murder She Wrote</a> is coming out on DVD. How can you not love that? Second, <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com" target="_blank">Havana Moderne</a> is back up and running as a functioning web site. It's still very hacky and in progress, but it's back on track and we're starting to get things documented again. Again? Finally? For once? Something like that. Viva la projects!

Also, when we visited the Botanic Gardens, Catherine and I discovered the best cookies ever. They're wafer-thin and lemony, and filled with crunchy goodness. Exactly the sort of thing one imagines would go perfectly with tea or coffee, but can't find when the need arises. <a href="http://www.moraviancookie.com/" target="_blank">Thank God, they're available on the Internet!</a> Three cheers for the Moravian Lemon Cookie.<br clear="all" />
