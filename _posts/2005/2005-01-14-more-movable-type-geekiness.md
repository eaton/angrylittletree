When I moved "Via Positiva":http://www.viapositiva.net and its associated blogs from "TypePad":http://www.typepad.com to a custom installation of Movable Type, the ability to customize was one of the big selling points. The only annoying bit has been the lack of TypePad's swanky <em>TypeList</em> feature. It let you collect bundles of links, or Amazon URLs, or RSS feeds, and stick them in the sidebar without hacking the HTML code.

Enter "MT-Outliner":http://mt-plugins.org/archives/entry/outliner.php -- an awesome Movable Type plugin by Chad Everett. Stick all your links into a standard OPML file, and MT-Outliner can render them into a cleanly formatted link list anywhere on your blog. I already had quite a few links an a convenient OPML file, and the new set of links to the right of this entry shows the results. I have to say... I'm really, really impressed with Movable Type and the functionality that it supports when paired with community-developed extensions.

It's cool. No question about it.

<em>Update: I've also added "RandomLine":http://mt-plugins.org/archives/entry/randomline.php to randomize the blog's tagline every time I post a new entry. In addition, I figured out how to tie MT-Outliner to the Movable Type administration interface. No more FTPing my links! The customization continues...</em>
