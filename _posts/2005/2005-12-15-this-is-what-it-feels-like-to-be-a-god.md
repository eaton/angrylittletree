So Catherine and I are out grocery shopping last night. Strolling thruogh the produce section at Jewel I see a product carefully tailored to peg my geek-o-meter. What is it?

<a href="http://www.grapplefruits.com">![](/files/packaging-both.jpg)</a>

A <i>Grapple.</i> Looks like an apple, tastes like a grape! The only way this could be improved, IMO, is by <a href="http://www.fizzyfruit.com/OurProducts.htm">carbonating it.</a> Science moves slowly but surely, though, and I'm not about to complain about the interim steps. I point excitedly and gesture to Catherine.

"Jeff, what possible purpose can there be for a grapple?"

"To defy nature! To spit in God's eye! Mad science needs no reason!"

I hold a package of grapples aloft and wind up for a maniacal cackle. She sighs and shakes her head and makes her way to the citrus section.

Sadly, <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/03/grapple.html">the guys at MAKE magazine</a> have unmasked this particular mechanical turk. Grapples are not, in fact, an unholy application of dark majick and bioengineering. They're just apples injected with grape juice. How pedestrian.
