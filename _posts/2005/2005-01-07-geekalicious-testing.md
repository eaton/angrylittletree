I'm testing out some of the new swanky formatting features that "Textile":http://bradchoate.com/weblog/2004/02/05/textile-tips adds to Movable Type... I have to say I'm really, really freakishly impressed. Like... wow.

You can automatically colorize code[1], _do simple formating_ and *styling* of your text using old reliable ASCII(American Standard Something Something Something) instead of HTML(HyperText Markup Language), handle special characters like (c), (tm), (r) and {Y=}...

# Do easy ordered lists
# Like This
## And have sublists
## Like this
# And even link to Google with a couple "keystrokes":google and do the same with "IMDB":imdb:Vanilla+Ice 

table. _|Good Idea|Bad Idea|What Textile Does|
^|Tables|Hand-formatting|Lets you use pipe characters|
^|CSS|Hacking each entry|Inline styles with simple shortcuts|
^|Conquest[2]|Militarism|Makes you happy|
^|Colspans|/2. Awwwwww, yeah. This puppy does 'em like they're supposed to be done. You want it? Textile does it. I'm totally sold.||

I'm pretty stoked. But YMMV(Your Mileage May Vary).

fn1. This requires the installation of the Beautifier plugin, -and it rocks.- Still trying to get it working, guraaahhh.

fn2. Seriously, who doesn't want that?
