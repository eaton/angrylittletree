Spent last night talking over wedding plans and other stuff with Catherine. It was good -- not just a happy-fairies-and-bunnies sort of way, but in a working-through-questions and learning-to-communicate and learning-to-trust-each-other sort of way. It's difficult sometimes, knowing a lot of the baggage that we both come with, the presuppositions and the ways of seeing the world and the people around us. But we're working through things, and growing, and learning more each day about how we both work and how we can speak truth to each other.

It's good.

I went to Jewel to pick up some soda, but got distracted in the floral section. I spent some time picking out each flower, finding the right greenery. The results aren't impressive -- I'm no florist -- but I love me the carnations, yes I do.
