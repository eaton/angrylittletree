I walked into the living room and found Catherine watching E!, a cable channel whose exclaimation mark identifies it as the most enthusiastic of all content providers. She was watching some sort of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/05/apontv.hughhefner.ap/">'Girls Next Door'</a> show about Hugh Heffner's girlfriends -- all four of them. Why? To figure out, she said, why a woman would <i>do that</i>



There's a priceless shot of three of them arguing about which Jim Carrey movie to watch while Hugh, nearly 80, watches with a detached and baffled expression. Poor, poor Hugh. You've surrounded yourself with identical blonde sorority girls, and now you must live with the consequences. After watching with her for half an hour, and carefully observing the behavior of the four, I believe there is a simple answer to Catherine's question: these women would not survive in the wild. The aggregate IQ of the Playboy Mansion is hovering somewhere around 250, I think, and that's <i>including</i> Hugh. I'm convinced that there <i>must</i> be full time security people making sure no one jams a spoon into the toaster at 3am.



There are many arguments regarding the pros, the cons, and the meaning of pornography in our culture. I don't want to imply that all women involved in the pornography industry are stupid. I just want to point out, based on E!'s inside look, that <i>Every Time Someone Buys Playboy, They're Interfering With Natural Selection.</i>
