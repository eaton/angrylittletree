This weekend has been doubleplusgood, without question. On the geeky side, I spent some time reworking the layout for the <a href="http://www.viapositiva.net">Via Positiva home page</a>, a sort of mini portal for the blogs that <a href="http://catherine.viapositiva.net">Catherine</a> and I maintain. The new layout feels cleaner, and cleanly separates the three blogs while making it easier to click through to read other entries. Yay for pure CSS layout!

Also, I spent Saturday with Catherine and it was splendiferous. We relaxed, lounged around and talked a lot, I read a few chapters of <em>Children of God</em>, and we visited my parents so they could see the ring and catch up and flutter happily. Both my father and I have always been shameless tech pack rats, with subtle heaps of legacy technology shoved into closets, awaiting some intended re-purposing that never comes. It looks like Mom and Catherine are already conspiring -- phrases like "You distract Jeff while I get them from Doug" were overheard, with much female giggling to follow. I am amused. It made us grin and chuckle, and even chortle. Admittedly, neither Dad nor I really <em>need</em> that old dead Mac Portable that's in the basement... it just feels to <em>wrong</em> to toss it!

Hung out with Jason and Steph and Steve yesterday evening, with some pizza and some MarioKart and some movie. It's pleasantly strange -- I'm falling into more and more of a rhythm with Catherine, not in the specific actions we act out day to day, but in the comfort and ease of <em>being with her.</em> We have misunderstandings and disagreements, and we work through them. We watch TV and we laugh at horrible commercials. We talk about writing, and reading, and love and it is good. We discuss housing options for after the wedding, when my lease will expire and I'll have to move regardless. It's <em>life with her</em>, and it is <em>good</em>. The idea of spending every day with her is sometimes more than I can even imagine.

There's interesting news kicking around, and some interesting developments with side projects Jason and I are working on... but it's late-lunchtime and I'll save those for later.
