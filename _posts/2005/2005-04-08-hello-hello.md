Zounds. What a week!

Preparations for our wedding (now only two months away) are consuming a lot of mental bandwidth these days, and work has spiked over the last couple of weeks to consume what free time remains. It's not bad -- just a bit frenzied.

Over the April 1st weekend, Catherine and I road-tripped up to Minneapolis for a wedding shower with her aunt and uncle, and a crowd of her close friends from college. It was great getting a chance to see her "in her element" with a whole gang of people who've known her for years, love her dearly, and also have incriminating college anecdotes that she never told <em>me</em> about. Bwa hah hah. I met Catherine's best friend and maid of honor, who'll be staying down here with us during the week leading up to the wedding. I spent hours and hours talking with Catherine's aunt and uncle, who are tremendously cool people. Thank God, they liked <me>me,</em> too. I passed the test!

Throwing caution to the wind, I even talked politics with her aunt. It was refreshing, fun, and thought-provoking. We've been on the opposite sides of many elections, but we both knew that we came at them from a similar set of principles, beliefs, and convictions. In light of our conversation, I'm grappling with deeper questions about the role of Christians in politics. How can we play a legitimate and honest role in a two-party system that does nothing more than pay lip service to fundamental moral concerns? Her observations on the issue of abortion were really interesting. Though she's spent decades as a Democratic activist, she's gravely concerned about the abortion litmus-test in the party at the local and national level. To her, being pro-life is about protecting the disenfranchised and defenseless -- something the Democratic party she grew up with always embraced.

And also, Catherine's uncle is a nuclear safety adviser who is overseeing a plan to <em>fire streams of neutrinos under the state of Wisconsin.</em> Seriously. How cool is that job? I dare anyone to find one cooler that doesn't require a leather duster.

<em>Random side note: As of 12:39 on April 8th, the <A href="http://costofwar.com/index-public-education.html">current cost of the war in Iraq could have paid to hire almost three million public school teachers for a year</a>. That'd certainly help the overcrowded classes. Priorities, priorities.</em>
