Occasionally, an idea grabs me, like a jungle cat, and shakes me about, demanding attention. When that happens, there's nothing to do but bow to the inevitable and roll with it. When Catherine said that she wanted to carve a few pumpkins this year, a tiny blinking light started flashing in my geeky forebrain. I would make... <i>The Jack-O-Bot</i>.

There is, of course, a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffeaton/sets/1209541/">flickr set</a> documenting the entire process in detail. Catherine, for her part, shakes her head and chuckles. I'm a lucky, lucky man.
