From the Associated Press: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=406086" target="_blank">White House Says Iraq Weapons Search Has Concluded.</a>

<blockquote>The search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has quietly concluded without any evidence of the banned weapons that President Bush cited as justification for going to war, the White House said Wednesday.
The Iraq Survey Group, made up of some 1,200 military and intelligence specialists and support staff, spent nearly two years searching military installations, factories and laboratories whose equipment and products might be converted quickly to making weapons.</blockquote>
