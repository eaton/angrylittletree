My new favorite publication of all time is <em>Make Magazine</em>. Back in the day, Catherine subscribed to <em>Victoria</em>, a lifestyle magazine that touched on crafting, feminist issues, gardening, and the hard to pin down <em>things readers think are cool</em> category. It left a mark, and she was quite sad when it shed this mortal coil due to advertising fall-off. <em>Make Magazine</em>, from what I can see of the first issue, is the geek's version of <em>Victoria</em>. Instead of fixating on new gadgets and hot consumer electronics, it features two hundred pages of DIY(Do-It-Yourself) projects and cool hacks. Kite photography? Sure! Home-made credit card swipe-reader? It's on page 80! $14 home-brew Steady-Cam rig? It's near the back. It's chock full of amazingly geekishly delicious projects like that, and I know that they own my soul for the lifetime of the magazine. Period. End of story.

One of the cooler little bits is an article on <em>building your own gauss gun</em> out of <em>magnets, rulers, and ball bearings</em>. A gauss gun, people! This is the sort of stuff that makes the geeky 11-year old boy deep in the heart of every man sing with joy. A couple guys even rigged up their own high-speed photo lab using <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Damonv/Public/Doombolt/">a lawn sprinkler, a cheap micro controller, and a gutted disposable camera</a>. Sigh.

I need a soldering iron.
