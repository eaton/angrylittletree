Well... in 24 hours I'll be standing under the branches of an old oak tree to be married to Catherine, the woman I love and will spend my life with. It's pretty big stuff for me (understatement!) and it's been a real adventure so far. I'll be gone for a week or two while we're off on our honeymoon. In the meantime, I'll toss out this thought on love and commitment:

by Wendell Berry



How joyful to be together,

alone as when we first were joined

in our little house by the river long ago

except now we know each other

as we did not then.

and now instead of two stories

jumbling to meet,

we belong to one story

that the two, joining, made.

And now we touch each other,

with the tenderness or mortals,

who know themselves how joyful

to feel the heart quake

at the sight of a grandmother,

old friend in the morning light,

beautiful in her blue robe.



I'll see everyone soon, when we're back from our honeymoon. Hooray!
