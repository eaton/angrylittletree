It has come to my attention recently that CNN, that <i>so-called news source,</i> engaged in subliminal warfare against the brave citizens of these United States. For almost <i>one eighth of a second</i>, the following 'X' defaced the inspiring visage of our country's Second In Command on live television.

Thankfully, the <a href="http://thepoliticalteen.net/2005/11/22/xvideo/">brave bloggers</a> of the blogging blogosphere of blogs were too crafty for CNN. Known for their careful attention to detail, they <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/flash3cnc.htm">alerted the world to the truth</a>. CNN, of course, investigated the matter and responded with typical liberal smokescreens. There was even talk among <a href="http://www.theshapeofdays.com/2005/11/oddness_at_cnn_.html">the weak-minded</a> that it had been an <i>accident</i>, rather than a deliberate conspiracy to erode the American populace's inspiring support for their Leader. The image, CNN apologists claimed, was a 'key frame' used by video technicians to queue video clips during broadcasts. The words 'Transition begins after five frames of black' can be made out below the debauched 'X' in the image above.



Friends, I've done some research into these so-called 'Key Frames.' I'm afraid that the situation is <i>even worse than we ever suspected.</i>



'Key Frames,' as liberals refer to them, have been in use for decades in the television industry. So cunning are the liberals that they saw the writing on the wall during the glorious time of Reagan. Knowing they could never defeat him honestly, they began to plan. They designed a nefarious video queueing mechanism and mobilized their agents in the video industry to infiltrate television studios around the world. It took years, but with 'Key Framing' accepted worldwide, the 'cover story' for their agents at CNN was in place.



They've been biding their time ever since, waiting through the dark days of the Amiga Video Toaster, counting the years, the months, the days, until they could spring their trap. Then -- when the time was right, and everything was in place -- their decades of planning paid off. BAM! Operation Key Frame! For 1/8th of a foul second, a flickered 'X' and the coded message flashed across the face of our glorious second-in-command!



The message? 'TRANSITION BEGINS AFTER FIVE FRAMES OF BLACK!'



Doubtless, it's a ciphered signal to their followers. But what could it mean? Regime change? Fomenting revolution? What -- or who -- could the 'five frames of black' be? I don't know, but it sounds mighty ominous...
