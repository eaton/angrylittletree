Over the last couple of weeks the number of spam comments to entries has been climbing. I've read about it and heard dire warnings, but I didn't think any steps would be necessary for a while. I was wrong, and I decided it was really annoying deleting five copies of TEXAS HOLD'EM! REFINANCE! PENIS! PENIS! from my comment queue every morning. Now, the blog only accepts comments from people who set up a TypeKey login -- it's an ultra quick comment, and there weren't TOO many people posting comments anyhow. I don't think it will be much of a hassle, but if there's a friend out there who's terribly, tremendously sad that anonymous comments can't be posted, drop me a line and I'll see if there's a better solution. Whee!
