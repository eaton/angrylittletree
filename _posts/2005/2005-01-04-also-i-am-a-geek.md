Spent some time over the holidays tinkering around with the ultra-freaky-cheap WinTV card that I found on DealNews. For $19, I now have the basic hardware necessary to build my own homebrew TiVo. I've amused myself by watching old AMC and History Channel movies in the background while checking email; hearing Cary Grant banter cross-mixed with Outlook's email chime is odd but fun. Next steps include securing a cheap copy of Windows Media center for the apartment media server and automatically recording fun stuff on the History Channel for later perusal.

Being able to do random screen captures at will, though, has me itching to start a caption-the-image contest. Witness:
