Over the past couple of weeks I've been hit by hundreds upon hundreds of trackback spams. Hojillions of them, even. I've received perhaps five or ten legitimate trackbacks, and at the moment I just don't have the patience to alter my blog's setup to filter them out. Blacklist isn't doing a stellar job -- it catches a few hundred but lets just as many through, thanks to the multiplicity of spammers scampering about.



Over the next couple of weeks I'm going to be migrating my blog to a Drupal install. I've been working with that engine on both <a href="http://www.kierkegaardlips.com">Kierkegaard Lips</a> and <a href="http://www.onehundredwords.com">One Hundred Words</a> for a month or two now and I'm thoroughly impressed. With judicious use of templates, Drupal's blog module can support all the look and feel niceness that Movable Type does, but it grafts on the coolness of a flexible CMS system. Lots of things I wanted to do (like keyword tagging of posts and automatic linking to related posts based on similar keywords) will come for free with Drupal and the addon modules I'm using.



Yes. I am a geek, folks. I am very geek.
