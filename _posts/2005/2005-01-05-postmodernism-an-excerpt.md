On a web board I visit frequently, someone asked about Christianity and Postmodernism -- asked about definitions, about thoughts on how the two interact, and so on. In the process of diving in and answering, I articulated a lot of things I've never really put in one place. So I figured I'd excerpt my reply here. It's rough, very much so, and a work in progress.
