Apple introduces a $500 computer smaller than my old external hard drive. It's all over. I'm p0wned. Eventually the entire apartment is going to be filled wit these things -- under tables, hanging from the walls, glued underneath tables, all chugging away on complex calculations or streaming MP3s or recording episodes of Monk or figuring out how to supplant humanity and take over the earth. I know it. I just know it.

Why, Apple? Why must you punch my buttons so?
