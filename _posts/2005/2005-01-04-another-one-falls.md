Penny Arcade is one of many winds beneath my metaphorical wings. <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/news.php3?date=2005-01-04" target="_blank">Gabe makes a shameful confession in his news entry today</a>:
<blockquote>So yesterday at the office I was sort of sketching and Tycho came over to my desk to see what I was doing. I hid my work and hissed at him until he left. Then Robert came in and asked what the hell I was doing. I broke down and explained I was drawing pictures of my WOW character and he looked at me with a mixture of pity and disgust. It's like he was looking at a good friend who was tragically hooked on the crack cocaine.... I used to make fun of Tycho when he'd come to me years ago with his sad little crumpled character sheets asking for drawings of dwarves or ridiculous Irish priest/paranormal investigators. Now here I am years later scribbling portraits of my own Night Elf Rogue and constructing elaborate stories of betrayal and lost love to fuel his online adventures.</blockquote>

It's so, so true. It's shameful, but even Catherine has been subjected to the compulsive  conversations that plague RPGers. "I... I have to tell you... just once.. this time, my character did something so cool..." What is it that forces us to say these silly, silly things? I don't know. I just don't. But really, if you'd only been there the time my decker got through all the security on just three lucky rolls...
