From <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20050122/od_nm/italy_coma_dc_1&cid=573">Yahoo News</a>:
<blockquote> Recalling the end of "Romeo and Juliet," the 70-year-old man, Ettore, who had sat by his wife's bedside for four months after she slipped into a coma following a heart attack, finally gave up hope and gassed himself in the garage of his family home.

Less than a day later, his wife, Rossana, woke up in her hospital bed in Padua and immediately asked for him. The northern town of Padua lies just 40 miles from Verona, where star-crossed lover Romeo killed himself believing Juliet to have died.</blockquote>

Tragic, but also vagely creepy and odd given the Romeo connection. How terribly sad.
