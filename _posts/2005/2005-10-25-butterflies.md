<A href="http://jeff.viapositiva.net/calendar"><img src="http://jeff.viapositiva.net/system/files?file=images/calendar_1.jpg" border=0 align=left hspace=5 vspace=5></a>Last year I pulled out a pile of my old photographs and put together a calendar for various friends. It was a fun gift, though I wondered to myself whether I'd be able to put together as many nice shots for 2006. Fortunately, I married Catherine and we honeymooned on gorgeous Mackinac Island, home of the tiniest butterfly conservatory in the world. One room, the size of a small apartment -- packed with <i>over a thousand butterflies</i>. Naturally, I went crazy with the digital camera. The end results were dazzling, more due to the huge concentration of butterflies than my photography skills. <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/mknbutterflies">I've put some of the best shots together into a 2006 calendar, greetings cards, and other sundry things.</a> Three cheers for the internet!
