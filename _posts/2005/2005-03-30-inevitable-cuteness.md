It's terribly spiffy, and I will not pretend that I'm not prone to bouts of sappiness about the whole thing. I get to spend my life with my spiffiest friend, who coincidentally is cool and gorgeous, to boot. What's not to love?

In any case, I scampered over to the Sprint PCS store and upgraded the cell phone plan to support two phones. Now Catherine has a spiffy little number with a bright color screen, and we can call each other for free. It's the sort of arrangements our ancestors would have marveled at, had they understood the implications of a national (nay, global) cell phone infrastructure.

The problem now, of course, is that I'm jealous of how spiffy her phone is. Mine is eligible for "trade-in rebates" in just thirty days, so I'm casting longing glances at the new crop of nifty-phones. Some of them are pretty insane; 1.3 megapixel digital cameras, MP3 players, SD card slots for software and video clips... Thanks to the wonders of Windows CE, there are even a couple of Sprint PCS phones that can play Age of Empires now... Clearly, I need more free time to play with cell phones.
