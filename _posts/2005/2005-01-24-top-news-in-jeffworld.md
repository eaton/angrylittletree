To say that this weekend was fabulous is to degrade it. It was scrumptious. Delicately yummy, robustly fantastic. Buried in contradictory accumulations of amazing adjectives. In short, yay.

Catherine's work schedule was a little odd, so she popped over after getting out on Thursday evening and crashed on the futon. That meant, of course, that in addition to seeing her Thursday I was able to have lunch with her Friday before she left for work. Happy day! Well... As it turns out, the blizzardy blustery snowstorms we've been having over the past couple of days meant that driving back to her home in rural-esque Big Rock was <em>a bad idea altogether</em> once the snow started falling in earnest. She booked it over to my apartment again, in The Land Of Roads That Actually Get Plowed When It Snows, and her mom was motherishly happy that she could be safe and sound. We spent the weekend together hanging out, watching movies, reading books, and so on. She explained <em>Wuthering Heights</em> to me, and I got her up to speed on the plot of <em>Rising Stars</em>, an excellent graphic novel if there ever was one. It's kind of fun, because there's no chance in hell she'll actually read it so I don't have to worry about giving away important spoilers. w00t!

Side note: The movie <em>"Tiptoes":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316768/</em> is now very high on my <em>unsettling and disconcerting</em> list. It is a story of dysfunctional dwarfs road tripping across America on motorcycles. And Matthew McConaughey. As the full-sized child of a dwarf family. <em>Matthew McConaughey.</em> It looks romantic and sweet and funny and cute. But about the time you get to dysfunctional trailer trash dwarf tarot reading drunken sexual liaisons with handguns...  Yeah. Yeah, you heard me right. Fear it, people. <em>Fear it.</em> I'm loathe to jump onto the French-bashing that's so rampant these days, but this time it's not politically motivated so I can do it with a clear conscience. <em>This movie is a French film, with all of the troubling and squicky things that implies.</em>

Sunday we had lunch and Catherine popped off to work. I amused my self by posting <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/node/15">fresh data</a> on <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/">Havana Mod</a>, playing through a couple tricky bits of Half Life 2, and... ahem. Attending a MechWarrior event. That's right. I'm that much of a geek. I took my little box of plastic clicky robots and hauled it to the comic book shop and I rolled my dice and I <em>kicked</em>, if I do say so myself, some <em>ass</em>. I won't bore anyone with the details (Catherine was already subjected to my victorious bouncing) but suffice to say the Jade Falcon heavy assault vehicles can really lay the smack down, and gave essential support to the two otherwise vulnerable light mechs I'd brought to the table. I went down hard in one of the three rounds when I panicked in the face of artillery, but the other two rounds were solid wins. Huzzah! I won a new little clicky robot, and he has <em>agility special equipment</em>. Some of you even know what that means. You know who you are.

More movie-watching with Catherine followed after her work, and today we're going to have lunch together, as it's her day off. Blizzard-related though it may be, having her crash here has been tremendously heart-warmingly nice. I want to spend my life with this woman, and the day-in day-out rhythms of morning, afternoon, and evening are the kind of pleasant, homey intimacy that I've always hoped and dreamed of but never really thought could be possible.

<em>Zowie.</em>
