Life's going good these days. Last night after work, Catherine and I had Steve, Jason, and Steph over for hanging-out and pizza and assorted catching-up. It was fun stuff, though we were thwarted in our attempts to watch a movie when Comcast's On-Demand service went down. There was a startled moment of "Did I forget to pay my bill?" followed by, "Wait, everything <em>else</em> is working..."



Couldn't sleep afterwords, so I spent some time tinker-tinker-tinkering on the <a href="http://www.onehundredwords.com">One Hundred Words</a> site while Catherine watched a Campion mystery. The site is finally migrated over to Drupal, with the comic browsing interface in a rough but usable state. As it evolves, I'll probably be posting mre. Someday, Jason and I will have new content as well. Heh.



Riding into work on my bike this morning, I realized with a start that <em>the breaks didn't work</em>. Apparently something had jostled around and one of the cables had unseated, and the brake handles were flapping loosely when I squeezed them. Not good, sirs. Not good at all. Some close examination after I coasted to a stop revealed the problem, and I tinkered with the cable anchors until I could fit everything back together. I feel strangely cool, having fixed the problem with my bike. I didn't even have to Google!
