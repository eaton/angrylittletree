I've had it looping for a while here, and I must say that David Holmes' soundtrack for "Oceans 12":amazon is a masterpiece. It's lush and grainy and 70stastic in all sorts of ways. It's get deep thick rhythms with Hammond organs and tambourines and funk guitars layering together. It's got synthetic French pop-rock that sounds like basements with faux wood paneling. It's got aesthetic arrogance but doesn't take itself too seriously.

I really, really dig it.
