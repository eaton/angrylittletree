This weekend, like the last, was rather smashingly good. Saturday morning I toddled off to meet Catherine for lunch and ended up hanging around Barnes and Noble for several hours while she worked. It was terribly nice being around her for the day -- she was able to swoop over and say hi and smile while she scampered from place to place, and... well. I was able to meander around accumulating larger and larger piles of books. I admit it: I fell off the wagon. There'll surely be a post at "The Reading Life":http://reading.viapositiva.net about this.

Saturday evening, Lou swing by from the city and we caught up. It's been waaaayy too long, and we had a good time eating Portillos and playing with clicky robots and powerleveling his "Front Mission 4":http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/fm4/ characters. He's only a few missions into it, and Elsa is already getting pretty beefy. Soon, she'll be shredding enemy attack choppers without blinking!

News flash! I'm getting hooked on typography again. It pains me deeply that I can't configure the typography of my blog with the precision I'd like to. I want everything in <em>"Bembo":http://www.linotype.com/128/bembo-family.html</em>, damnit! Along those lines, "Thinking With Type":http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/ is a really great site. It's a companion to the book of the same name, and it explains a lot of the core concepts of typography. Yummmmmy.

Speaking of yummy, I picked up a cookie Sunday while I was out with Catherine. I put it in my jacket pocket and keep forgetting it was there. In the twenty-four hours since then, every time I check my keys I rediscover the cookie and smile brightly. "Hey! I've got a cookie!" I promptly go on with what I was doing, and forget about the cookie, starting the cycle again. Life should be full of such wonderful discoveries!

Important announcement to come shortly. Soonish. It is perhaps a <em>sparkly</em> announcement.
