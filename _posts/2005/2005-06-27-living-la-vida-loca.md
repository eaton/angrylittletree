So Catherine and I are married. I plink repeatedly when I say that, because it's so wild and crazy. I'm married! To her! Catherine! Zow!



The wedding itself was crazy, beautiful, and amazing. Last minute stresses cropped up (as they always do) with the combination of tiny ceremony and friends who we weren't able to invite, weather worries, and so on and so forth. But it came together, happily, and everyone in attendance said that the ceremony (with flowers everywhere, in a small secluded spot on Catherine's parents' farm) was beautiful and moving. We had our honeymoon on Mackinac Island, a strange place full of wonder and spiffiness -- I'll surely be posting some of the hundreds of photos I took there. I purchased cheesy souvenirs and pounds upon pounds of fresh fudge. Catherine and I biked and read and relaxed and laughed and also had rich scrumptious food until we passed out and groaned and begged for unseasoned vegetables with nothing even resembling "rich sauce." The food is good there, let me tell you.

It's on its way to becoming a nice little place to live, as opposed to a chaotic sprawl of bachelor-mess. We watched old movies and recuperated and (again) laughed a lot. Life is good. Both of us are back to work today (sigh!) and getting into the swing of life with each other. It's good, this life, with my dear friend and love, my <em>wife</em>. Crazy crazy times!
