Spent some time talking about <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com">the infamous side project to end all side projects.</a> It took a while to hit on some of the stuff Catherine was getting at, but the result was a light bulb lighting for me -- regarding both my own feelings about the project and its meaning in my life, and some of the developments for key characters in the <a href="http://www.onehundredwords.com">graphic novel</a>. Jason and I spring-boarded off of that, and the results are encouraging. Some key scenes have tightened up, the dramatic arc for the first year feels a lot more compelling, and Caleb Reis, the main character, popped into three dimensions after a long life as a 'generic archetypical cool guy.' We're going over things with a fine-tooth comb now, writing dialogue for scenes, tweaking the details and so on.
 
<a href="http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/gallery/galatea/">One of the winners of the 2000 Interactive Fiction Contest</a> is now online for convenient web exploration. "Galatea" is a weird-but-cool talking statue, capable of conversing and interacting in text. Use the standard 'look, say, etc' commands to tinker with it.
 
Salon magazine has <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2005/02/21/nazi/index.html">an interesting interview</a> with Rochus Misch, the last survivor of Hitler's ill-fated bunker in 1945. As Hitler's bodyguard, Misch had up-close-and-personal access to der fuhrer for years. It's unsettling but fascinating. At one point, he complains that there are no memorials for the dead children of Goebbels...

<blockquote><strong>Salon:</strong> The murder of the children was terrible, but for every one of them, 1 million Jews were killed with less reason, to say nothing of the many, many others who died at the hands of the Nazis.
<br />
<strong>Mesch:</strong> That may be. But I ask you, <em>if Hitler really did all the terrible things people now say he did, how could he have been our Fuhrer?</em> How is it possible? </blockquote>

In other news, author and blogger Cory Doctorow continues to release his work to the public for free download almost as soon as it's published. <a href="http://craphound.com/place/download.php">A collection of his short stories is online, too</a>. I'm fascinated by his willingness to release his books under the Creative Commons license, and he argues persuasively that open intellectual property doesn't harm creative works. I'm intrigued, but I must confess that it's <em>scary</em> to contemplate as Jason and I work on the graphic novel. We've put a lot of work into it. How will we approach those thorny issues?
