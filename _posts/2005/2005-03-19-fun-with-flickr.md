Grabbed a ride into the city last night to see Jason's band, <a href="http://www.thesatellitepictureshow.com"> The Satellite Picture Show</a>, play in a battle at The Note. Had a great time hanging out and catching up with some familiar faces I haven't seen in a while, and took a small pile of photos. It's been quite a while since I did that (months? certainly) and it felt really good. I enjoy photography a lot, and I feel refreshed after getting and getting good stills.

With my old Livejournal, I posted photo collections on a semi-regular basis. Organizing them was a pain, though, and I always imagined I would do it better if I ever moved to a MT-based blog. Now that the time is here, I'm still trying to figure out the best way to do it. Use a separate blog? Design a layout optimized for it? I don't know! It's all so complicated. In the meantime, I thought I'd take a shot at using <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, the hip new photo site that all the cool kids seem to be using. From what I can tell, it's some sort of mutant Shutterfly-Friendster hybrid that pointedly targets bloggers.

So, without further ado, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/70315202@N00/tags/thesatellitepictureshow/show/">a slideshow of last night's concert.</a>
