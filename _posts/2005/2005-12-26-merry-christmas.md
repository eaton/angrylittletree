The holidays have been crazy, but Catherine and I are settling in to enjoy a relaxing conclusion. Among other varied and sundry gifts, I received a USB adapter for my old Edmund Scientific microscope. It's been a decade or so since I pulled it out, and I eagerly hooked it up, focusing on a torn off bit of wrapping paper. Man... at 150x magnification, little halftoned dots of Santa-Clause look weeeeeird.



Merry Christmas, everyone!<br clear=all>
