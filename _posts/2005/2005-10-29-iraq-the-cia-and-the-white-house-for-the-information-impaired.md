A friend of mine -- someone I do respect and enjoy talking with on many subjects -- is also pretty conservative. In an attempt to counteract some of the jouyous liberal celebration regarding Scooter Libby's downfall, he posted a link to <a href="http://realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-10_25_05_CKI.html">an article about <i>The Untold Story</i> of Judith Miller and Joe Wilson.</a> It contained a giggle-inducing number of basic factual errors, but aside from that it trotted out the old accusation the the CIA has been 'out to get the President' since day one.



Using the CIA as an institutional fall-guy has been popular over the last couple of years. If you'll remember, when everyone realized that Iraq had no WMD's and was a complete non-threat to the US, much was made of Bad Intelligence Data From The CIA. "We were just going on what we were told" was the excuse du jour, before 'We were just trying to bring democracy all along' became the popular spin.



To those who had been following the build-up to war and investigating the intelligence from day one, this line was hilarious. Clearly, though, some people don't get the joke. For them, I've provided this helpful chart.

 

<b>How Dangerous Was Iraq?</b>

Look closely at it and ponder it for a moment. Iraq was a complete military non-threat. It wasn't even a paper tiger -- it was a paper badger.  The White House, though, thought it was super-duper holy bejeebus let's blow stuff up dangerous. This was the argument favored by Sadaam, of course, who had a vested interest in telling everyone he was supremely dangerous.



The CIA, though, disagreed. The CIA is charged, mind you, with finding out stuff -- not acting as the White House's marketing agency. They still <i>over-estimated</i> the danger posed by Sadaam and Iraq, but based on what they knew they insisted the situation was nowhere near as dire as the White House insisted it was. In response, the White House pretty much stopped listening to the CIA and started generating its own intelligence data from sources that confirmed its view of things.



When the dust finally settled and it turned out that Sadaam was a threat to his own people and no one else (like the vast majority of dictators currently in power around the world), the CIA took the blame. Because, y'know, they overestimated how dangerous he was.



How does this relate to the Joe Wilson case and <a href="http://realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-10_25_05_CKI.html">our favorite piece of partisan hackery?</a> Joe Wilson went to Niger to investigate claims that Sadaam was buying uranium there. The White House was using these claims to help prove that Iraq was dangerous. The CIA was skeptical, and had told the White House as much -- they sent someone to investigate further and determined that it was, in fact, a baseless story. They were right.



If that's what the writer calls a "covert operation" conducted against President Bush, perhaps the CIA was a bit too easy on him.
