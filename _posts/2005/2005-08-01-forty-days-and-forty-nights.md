So, in a fit of lunchtime curiosity, I picked up a book that I haven't opened in a few years -- <I>Discovering the Writer Within</i> by Bruce Ballenger. It's an interesting one, and it has forty daily exercises. It's been a while since I've held myself to any sort of schedule or deadline with my writing, so it should be fun. Later this afternoon, I'll post the first entry -- the entire series will be flagged with the '40days' tag.
