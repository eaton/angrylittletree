I did some poking around today and found a fun <a href="http://flagrantdisregard.com/flickr/mosaic.php">Flickr tool</a> that generates mosaic images from any photoset. There's a certain number of sites that seem to have hit critical mass and become Internet utilities, like water and gas and electricity in the physical world. Flickr, Blogger/Livejournal, Amazon, eBay, Google, PayPal, and so on...



In any case, it's fun and pretty!
