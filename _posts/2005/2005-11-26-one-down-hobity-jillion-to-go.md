So, I mentioned in my previously posted Drupal To-Do list that I wanted to whip up an Amazon 'reading list' module for single and multi-user blogs. Thanks to the holiday weekend, I put some time into it and a rough initial version is <a href="http://cvs.drupal.org/viewcvs/drupal/contributions/modules/bookroll/">now available</a> in the Drupal.org repository.



I want to get a few things cleaned up before I put an official project page up for it in particular, the theming leaves something to be desired and I want more options for configuring and displaying the 'states' a given book can be in. It also requires a patched version of amazon.module for Drupal 4.7... something I figure most people aren't using at the moment.



Still... progress!
