I remember hearing Moby for the first time about a decade ago. <em>Cool World</em> had just come out -- a shallow, hypersexualized <em>Roger Rabbit</em> knockoff starring Brad Pitt in one of his first lead roles. I never saw the movie, but Moby's Next Is The E single was on the soundtrack and got loads of attention. Christian Music Industry Boy that I was, I'd heard rumors about Moby being a Christian, and thought his <em>Go</em> release a listen. I liked it. A lot.



Being the conservative kid that I was, the essays scrawled throughout the liner notes for Animal Rights offended me -- the nerve of this liberal! Spouting off about <em>Jesus!</em> But as I got older and grew to appreciate -- if not agree with -- the stuff that Moby was obviously grappling with in his writing, I got back into the habit of listening to his newer stuff. I still don't like all of it -- he's done some weird punk stuff that left me cold, and apparently he even has a few unreleased country tracks lying around that he made for kicks.



Now, though, that scatter shot feel is one of the things I love about his work. He's evolved out of "Techno Poster Boy" and seems to be chilling in "Artist Who Does Whatever He Wants" land. When I pick up a new Moby CD, I'm honestly not sure what I'll hear. There'll be common touches, sure, and he generally stays within arm's reach the previous release's style. From one CD to the next, though, it's cool to hear him experimenting, applying a great ear and good production and his personality to a changing and evolving sound.



It's a refreshing contrast to artists and bands who seem to 'mine a style,' then move on with a calculated freshening-up. U2's new stuff feels like that to me -- less exploration, more thrashing around looking for "a new sound."
