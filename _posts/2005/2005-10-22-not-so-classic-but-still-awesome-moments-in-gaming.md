So I'm playing Shadow of the Colossus, and it's everything I'd hoped. As the guys at Penny Arcade said, creating a game in which sixteen powerful 'boss' characters comprise the entire conflict is gutsy. Somehow, though, the action-focus of this sequel to Ico doesn't feel <i>that</i> much different than the first game. The beautiful landscapes, the subtle touches like the headstring tugs of your horse at its reigns, the misty fairy-dusty visuals, the strangely sad music...



Ico was a work of sublime genius. While this game is different, it's still part of the same family. I wonder if the third will be a RTS...
