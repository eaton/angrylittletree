It's been observed that I don't slag on left-leaning political people. Let me take the opportunity: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1896&u=/nm/20040830/us_nm/campaign_protest_broadway_dc_4&printer=1">Dumbass protesters in New York</a> hang around Broadway, heckling theatergoers and shouting threats. Mind you, it was a couple dozen people out of a crowd of over a <i>hundred thousand</i> who'd travelled to NYC for a protest event.

Over a <i>hundred thousand people</i> showed up to protest Bush's policies. But y'know what? It's the image of a couple dozen people on a streetcorner shouting at theater-goers that will stand out in the public's mind. Good job, guys. Good job.
