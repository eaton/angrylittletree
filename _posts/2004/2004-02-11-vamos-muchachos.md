Last night at <a href="http://www.fusioncentral.net" target="_blank">Fusion</a>, I led the second discussion/teaching segment in a series that <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> and I have been putting togther. We got off to a frustrating start; we're trying to encapsulate some complex ideas that both of us have been chewing on for several years. Last night, however, really flowed well. It was encouraging, exciting, and people seemed to click with it.

A couple friends have requested that I post the notes from it, so here they are. If you're not interested in reading hellaciously spammy Christian Bible Study Notes, feel free to skip this entry. I won't be hurt. ;-)

<!--break-->Bear in mind there are some ad-libbed parts. These are my notes, not my a transcript. Portions marked in bold and verses were usually times when I asked someone else to read to give my voice a rest and let peopel hear someone other than me talking. Heh. ANyhow, here goes:

<b>YE OLDE NOTES</b>

Last week, we spent some time talking about the concept of The Kingdom of God. It's something Jesus talked about all the time during his three years traveling and teaching. At the time, a lot of people thought he was talking about a political revolution to kick Rome out of Israel and restore the "Good old days" of Israeli independence. And today, as Christians, it's easy for us to look at the things he said and assume that he's talking about some time in the future - Heaven - when everything will be perfect, and we won't have to worry about a lot of the messed up stuff that's a part of the world we live in.

What we discussed last week, is the idea that most of the time, Jesus wasn't talking about either of those extremes. Instead, he was talking about a completely different way of living and experiencing life - a mode of being that's grounded in knowing God, growing closer to Him, and becoming more like Him. That's a lot different than either of the views we discussed last week - the political revolution, and the "future promise" - because it's not about a change in my surroundings. It's about a change in me.

What we're going to focus on tonight is what that looks like. At least for those of us tonight who've been in the church for a while, I don't think it's a really new concept. But it's easy for us to overlook, again and again, the meat of what he talked about in favor of our own assumptions.

<b>[ QUESTION AND ANSWER ]</b>
Break to discuss. What would be different about ME in heaven? [5-10 minutes, then return. Write down answers on white board for later use ]

One of the interesting things about Jesus is that he tended to have lots of conflicts with religious leaders. His followers took flack for violating religious laws that the leaders had set up to help people maintain ritual purity and holiness. One of the underlying themes of Christ's teaching, though, was that my heart is what matters, and the external actions are a secondary concern.

<b>[ VERSE ]</b>
<blockquote>"How terrible for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock the door to the Kingdom of heaven in people's faces…. You give to God one tenth even of the seasoning herbs… but you neglect to obey the really important teachings of the Law, such as justice and mercy and honesty. These you should practice, without neglecting the others. Blind guides! You strain a fly out of your drink, but swallow a camel! How terrible for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of your cup and plate, while the inside is full of what you have gotten by violence and selfishness. Blind Pharisee! Clean what is inside the cup first, and then the outside will be clean too!"
(Mat 23:13, 23-26)</blockquote> 

Now, a couple of the phrases in there are interesting. He talked about straining gnats out of drinks, and giving herbs to God… those were a couple examples of some of the guidelines that the Pharisees had set up for holiness and cleanliness. It's  easy to see them as JUST legalistic and controlling, but I think that's dangerous. In many, many cases the Pharisees were sincere believers who wanted to pursue God and become holy, to serve Him. And they went above and beyond what He had even commanded in Scripture - with laws like gnat-straining and herb-donating. But Jesus' big point was that no amount of law would really change the heart.

<b>[ VERSE ]</b> 
<blockquote>"A healthy tree does not bear bad fruit, nor does a poor tree bear good fruit. Every tree is known by the fruit it bears; you do not pick figs from thorn bushes or gather grapes from bramble bushes. A good person brings good out of the treasure of good things in his heart; a bad person brings bad out of his treasure of bad things. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of."
(Luk 6:43-45)</blockquote> 

In one of the more heated discussions he had with Pharisees, he talked about the lengths that we should go to to avoid sin… It's interesting, though, to read this verse in light of what he preached, and what the Pharisees believed.

<b>[ VERSE ]</b>
<blockquote>"You know the commandment which says, 'Be faithful in marriage.' But I tell you that if you look at another woman and want her, you are already unfaithful in your thoughts. If your right eye causes you to sin, poke it out and throw it away. It is better to lose one part of your body, than for your whole body to end up in hell. If your right hand causes you to sin, chop it off and throw it away! It is better to lose one part of your body, than for your whole body to be thrown into hell." 
(Mat 5:27-30)

"If your eye makes you lose your faith, take it out! It is better for you to enter the Kingdom of God with only one eye than to keep both eyes and be thrown into hell."
(Mar 9:47)</blockquote>

That set of verses sounds pretty extreme -- and it is. Often, we look at those as a statement by Jesus on the lengths we should go to to avoid sin. If we step back, though, and see it in the context of what he taught and who he was talking to, it takes on a different feel. The Pharisees tried to achieve holiness and purity by avoiding bad actions, and set up huge lists of rules and regulations to avoid things that might lead to impurity. Christ taught that focusing on the externals was a waste of time -- that the heart was where the real action was, and the actions were simply fruit. When you look at those verses in that light, it's interesting. He doesn't seem to be saying we should go mutilate ourselves... Instead, he's talking about the absurdity of solving inner issues with outer fixes. A blind man can lust, and a man with no hands can still envy -- because his eyes and his hands weren't the real problem at all. My eyes can't cause me to sin, my hand can't cause me to sin. 

It's important to note that Jesus wasn't just talking about abandoning the laws God had given down, or sinning because He didn't have to follow rules. He was getting at something deeper. Intro Francis Schaeffer quote:

<b>[ READ QUOTE ]</b>
<blockquote>"…On that particular night everybody present was a Christian, many of them from groups in countries where "lists" had been very much accentuated. They began to talk against the use of taboos, and at first as I listened to them I rather agreed with them, in the direction they were going. But as I listened further to this conversation, and as they spoke against the taboos in their own countries, it became quite clear to me that what they really wanted was merely to be able to do the things the taboos were against. What they really wanted was a more lax Christian life. We must see that in giving up such lists, in feeling the limitation of the "list" mentality, we must not do this merely in order to be able to live a looser life: it must be for something deeper.... We do not come to true spirituality or the true Christian life merely by keeping a list, but neither do we come to it merely by rejecting the list and then shrugging our shoulders and living a looser life.

"When we are done with our honest wrestling before God, very often we will find that we will be observing at least some of the taboos on these lists. But having gone deeper, we find that we will be observing them for a completely different reason.... It is no longer a matter of holding to an accepted list in order that [other] Christians my thing well of us."

Francis Schaeffer, True Spirituality</blockquote>


I think that hits on something really, really profound. But it's important that the meat of Christ's teaching wasn't just about the things we don't do. It was about what kind of things would flow out of a fundamentally changed life. What kind of positive things. The core of the Beatitudes, one of Christ's most memorable sermons, is the Golden Rule. Anybody remember it?

<b>[ Wait for response ]</b> 
It's interesting that the same sentiment appears in almost every major religious faith the world has ever known - at least, part of it.

<b>[ Read different versions ]</b>
<blockquote>Buddhism / Treat not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful. The Buddha, Udana-Varga 5.1 

Hinduism / This is the sum of duty: do not do to others what would cause pain if done to you. Mahabharata 5:1517 

Judaism / What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbour. This is the whole Torah; all the rest is commentary. Go and learn it.  Hillel, Talmud, Shabbath 31a

Zoroastrianism / Do not do unto others whatever is injurious to yourself. Shayast-na-Shayast 13.29 

Christianity / In everything, do to others as you would have them do to you; for this is the law and the prophets. Jesus, Matthew 7:12</blockquote> 
<b>[ QUESTION ]</b> What's missing in most of those teachings that's there in Jesus' words? The positive. Jesus didn't just tell people to avoid hurting others -- he tells us to go out and do for other people what we would want done for us.

That isn't to say that other faiths don't stress the importance of doing good. But the natural human tendency is to focus on avoiding bad acts. Jesus never let people stay there. He emphasized the positive things that would flow out of a truly transformed heart - the fruit that would come from a good tree.

<b>[ VERSES ]</b> <blockquote>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control--against such things there is no law. 
(Gal 5:22-23)

You received Christ Jesus the Lord, so continue to live as Christ's people. Sink your roots in him and build on him. Be strengthened by the faith that you were taught, and overflow with thanksgiving. 
(Col 2:6-7)</blockquote> 

According to Jesus' teaching, this is really the meat of what we were created to be. This kind of stuff is what it's all about. Not a specific set of actions, because those never really touch the heart. Not a specific set of duties or obligations, because those lead to the kind of ritual that the Pharisees talked about.

He's talking about people beginning to live lives the way God created them to in the first place. Healthy, whole lives. That word wholeness is interesting, too - at its core, the word 'whole' comes from the same root as the word 'holiness.' While the Pharisees were trying to become holy, or whole, by DOING more and more things… Jesus told them it was a waste of time unless they really were whole and healed in their hearts. Once that took place, the actions they felt were essential would simply flow out of their inner state.
	
<b>[ AD LIB GOES HERE ]</b>

It's especially interesting to think about that in light of the question we talked about earlier - How Will I Be Different In Heaven. Some of the most common answers we came up with, like "I wouldn't be jealous," "I'd be more peaceful, and have more purpose," and "I'd see others the way God sees them," are all about what's going on in my heart. Jesus did talk about the future promise of Heaven sometimes. But Heaven, in this view, isn't just some perfect place where our circumstances are more pleasant. It's about the fulfillment of this different way of living and being. It's about everyone being whole, and healed, and healthy - and demonstrating those good fruits like kindness and love and joy and peacefulness and patience in every moment.

Step back for a moment and imagine all of the amazing things that humanity has done. The art, the acts of selflessness, the inspiring music, the writing, the food… Tetris! Just think. If humanity, suffering under the weight of its own brokenness and fear and sin and pain, with the daily consequences of our lifetimes of choices and sins and hurts pressing down on us… if we can come up with something as intensely playable as Tetris in this fallen, broken world, just imagine the kind of sheer playability that heaven might hold.

<b>[ Pause for incredulous stares ]</b>

And here's the kicker. Christ, when he was teaching, talked about people being that way in the here and now, too. As we break up for discussion etc, let's thing about this question: what would my life look like in the here and now? And what's keeping me from it? 


<b>[ BREAK FOR DISCUSSION QUESTIONS ]</b>
<ol>
<li> How do I believe I'd be different in Heaven? </li>
<li> What's keeping me from being that way now? </li>
<li> What's the difference between being kind and doing something kind? Between being joyful and doing something joyful? </li>
<li> Is it possible to do those things without being those things? </li>
<li> Is it possible to be those things (joyful, kind, loving) without doing joyful, kind, and loving things? Why? What's the difference between 'being' something and 'doing' something? </li>
