So, last night Catherine and I saw <i>I Heart Huckabees,</i>

It's probably a terrible commentary on both of us that we were laughing out loud more times than we could count at a movie in which characters are shameless proxies for dominant philosophical schools. But... but... There are bonnets! And jet skis! And the univers is a giant blanket! And there's this story about a cave, see...

We first caught the trailer surfing on the net, and knew we had to see it. The plot is a spartan little thing in which Jason Schwartzman (poet and activist) is caught between his art and the need for corporate assistance in fighting suburban sprawl. In a fit of personal angst and self-doubt, he hires a pair of Existential Detectives played brilliantly by Lilly Tomlin and Dustin Hoffman. They're unexpectedly <i>cute.</i> Really! As a pair of philosophical gumshoes who've spent decades helping the metaphysically baffled find the Answers To Life's Big Questions, they have the easy, intimate connection of an elderly couple sharing an in joke. Tomlin the Western Empiricist and Hoffman the Eastern universalist play off of each other perfectly as they tail Schwartzman's character, conspicuously coaxing and prodding him through his crisis.

As the movie progresses, every subsequent character is a perfect archetype -- a walk-on part for a philosophy.
There's The Materialist, a corporate PR guy who plays Silverman's nemesis. There's The Nihilist, Tomlin and Hoffman's rival. Marky Mark plays Schwartzman's fellow seeker of truth in the form of a jaded anti-petrolium conspiracy theorist. He's perfect as a sincere-but-passionately-unhinged guy in the middle of a slow-roasted personal epiphany. In jokes fly fast and furious ("It's like that story about the cave they told me!") and the characters play out deliciously perfect conflicts between rival schools of thought.

I'm probably not making much sense as I write the review, but... if you've ever giggled at a joke about Kierkegaard, had a midlife crisis at at 17, or had a serious discussion about the interconnectedness of good and evil and how it relates to Nike sweatshop sneakers... You will watch it and love it and laugh yourself silly. See it. Know it. Love it. Seeing it with Catherine was a treat, if only because she almost choked laughing at the same oblique philosophical references. She rocks my world.

I Heart Huckabees.
