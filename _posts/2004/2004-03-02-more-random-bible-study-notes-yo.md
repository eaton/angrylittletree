<b>The Kingdom of God</b>
The Kingdom of God is the heart of our series. It’s something Jesus talked about a lot; it appears in Scripture all the time. Although his early followers often mistook it for a political revolution that would liberate them from Rome, and we as Christians often think of it as the future that we have in Heaven, both of those miss the mark. At its heart, it’s an internal transformation, a lifestyle and an entire way of being that God has called us to and Christ modeled every moment of his Life. Heaven is a future promise for us – the fruition and completion of that – but it’s also something very tangible, something here and now. It’s basically the practice of being who God created us to be, each in our own unique ways, reflecting the beauty and the goodness that He made us for. God desires it for us every day.

<b>Being vs. Doing</b>
We dug a little deeper after that, exploring the idea of being versus doing. When Jesus taught, he always came back to the idea that what’s inside our hearts is the most important thing to consider. Although my actions are important, and I can’t just dismiss them, they always flow out of my motivations, my desires, my inner state of being. The more I focus on the external things, the more I try to change them without that inner transformation, the more work, energy, and frustration I’m putting into things. I’m more likely to skip over what Christ said was truly important, and I’m more likely to judge others for not following the same set of actions that I am. But as I focus on those internal motivations, those internal desires and inclinations of my own heart, and those are transformed – my state of being changes and the doing part flows naturally from that. 

<b>Living in the Moment</b>
The kind of life-altering shift that Christ talked about, of internal transformation changing who we are, and actions flowing out of that as natural consequences, is pretty cool, but it can also be sobering and even depressing. I can’t just flip a switch and change my life, change who I am, and change my personality. It’s like a New Years resolution times ten – the chances that I’ll make it past the middle of March are very, very slim. In 1st Corinthians 10:13, Paul writes that God has promised us that he’ll never allow us to be tempted beyond what we can withstand. He’ll always provide a way to escape that – a way for me to be, in any given circumstance, the kind of person He created me to be. I’m not perfect, and I fail, and I sin. I can’t change what happened a year, a month, a day, an hour ago – and I can’t really change what will happen off in the future. It may be easier or more difficult depending on the habits I’ve built up to this point, but right now, at this instant, I can be exactly the kind of person that God created me to be. That’s His promise. That may be calling out for help when I think I can’t do it on my own – but that, too, is part of what He created me to be.
 
<b>How We See</b>
Now, as we put these things together, a picture starts to emerge – a way of living that focuses on learning more about God, connecting with Him, understanding who He created me to be, and reflecting that in my choices on a moment by moment basis. Not necessarily the specifics – Tuna fish versus chicken for lunch, etc. – but in the internal stuff that our actions come out of. The problem is, that can be even more difficult to change than my outward actions, many times. I can put a lot of energy into trying not to hit my coworker if he annoys me, and I can stop that, but how am I supposed to change that desire and inclination to hit him? Scripture says that God works in us, and helps us, but we also have to make choices along with it. One of the biggest things we can do, is choose to look at the world around us differently. Everything we see is viewed through the ‘lenses’ we use.

<b>Tying it together</b>
Put together, these different ideas can give us a picture of a way of living that’s wildly different than what most of us are used to. It may not look terribly different in big, dramatic ways – it’s not about suddenly going off to Africa, or starting to fast, or changing your personality or something like that. But it has the potential to fundamentally alter how each one of us experiences life, how we interact with the world and the people around us, and how we see God fitting into it. Sometimes, it may result in those big, huge things. In changing my behaviors and lifestyle in ways that go above and beyond what people say “good people have to do.” But the reason for those big changes will be the knowledge that God, specifically, wants me doing that in that moment, because it’s who He created me to be. Not because I feel I have to get into spiritual one-upmanship to keep myself ‘Good.’ 

<b>So, Where Are We Going Now?</b>
Up to this point, a lot of this stuff has been pretty abstract. We’ve talked about some specific examples, but it’s been all ideas. Over the next couple of weeks, we’re going to be exploring different areas of life – work, relationships, living in the Church, and stuff like that. They’re all topics we’re familiar with and have even talked about before, but this time around we’re going to be looking at them specifically from the perspective of this whole ‘Kingdom of God’ thing. In all these areas we’re exploring, the questions for each of us are:
<ol>
<li> How would this area of life be different if I put my energy into being a different kind of person rather than doing different things? </li>
<li> How would this area of my life be different if I chose to focus on the opportunities I have right now, and the kind of person that I will become as I make those choices, rather than making “New Years Resolutions?” </li>
<li> How is this area of my life affected by the way that I look at the situation? How would it be different if I could change the way I see it? </li>
<li> How is this area of my life an opportunity, every day, moment by moment, to be who God created me to be, unique and complete and whole? How is it an opportunity to pull down a little piece of the Kingdom of Heaven and share it with the world around me? </li>
</ol>
