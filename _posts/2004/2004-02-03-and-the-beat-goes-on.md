What a wild, crazy few weeks it's been. Haven't posted a serious update in quite a while, and I don't know how serious this one will be. What's new?

<a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> and I hosted our first <i>Superbowl Party.</i> Pretty impressive for a pair of software developers who didn't even know that South Carolina <i>had</i> a football team a few months ago. More than anything, it was an opportunity to get the <a href="http://www.fusioncentral.net" target="_blank">Fusion crew</a> together and enjoy a party. It was a lot of fun, even if Ms. Jackson's clothing malfunction gave <a href="http://rdecker.livejournal.com">rdecker</a> and <a href="http://ksocall.livejournal.com">ksocall</a> cause to traumatize us by explaining the concept of <i>pasties.</i> I'm not sure if it's good or bad that I was terribly ignorant on the subject.

New band discovery of the month: <a href="http://www.emperornorton.com/mod/artistpage.php3?artist=pepe_deluxe" target="_blank">Pepe Deluxe</a>, an ultra-swanky Finnish hip hop troupe. Really tight turntable work, strangely sampled 70's funk songs, and airy female vocals when they're called for. Cruel Youth in particular is an awesome single, and I'll probably be working it onto a comp or two in the future. It's very yummy.

Other randomness? <a href="http://www.platinumgrit.com" target="_blank">Platinum Grit</a>, one of my favorite deranged comics, is finally posting additional back issues from its one-year run. It's relatively hard to find in print, so the webbed version is quite cool. The first four issues are finally up, so the sequence of events makes more sense. At least, as much sense as can be made from a story about immortal Scotsmen, fursuit-wearing vigilante riot Grrls, talking Jamaican wardrobes, exploding turtles, and time travel.

And, of course, gratuitous cuteness:

It's <a href="http://FuR.livejournal.com">FuR</a>'s kitty Milo, and I caught a shot of him at her party a couple weeks ago. Whee!
