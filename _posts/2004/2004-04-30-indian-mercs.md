Hey, <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a>... Remember our conversation about mercs in Iraq? Looks like the contracting companies are casting their nets far and wide...

<a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/FD30Df05.html">According to an article in Asia Times,</a> <i>"US and British security sub-contractors are seeking out Indian ex-servicemen known for their professionalism and discipline for deployment in Iraq. "</i> It sounds like hundreds have already jumped at the opportunity, though the Indian government is worried -- they don't <i>want</i> to be in Iraq, and having large chunks of citizenry there for the paycheck might be unkosher.

Update: <a href="http://www.back-to-iraq.com/archives/000755.php" target="_blank">The latest BackToIraq update</a> provides some interesting, and troubling, details about the contractors who've been running interrogations. Apparently they're neck-deep in the recent torture allegations.
