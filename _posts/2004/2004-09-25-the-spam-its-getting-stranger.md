In other news, <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> and I saw <i>Resident Evil 2</i>. I can't really say much about the film -- Like <i>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</i>, it was an extremely elaborate in-game cutscene without the game. I know I shouldn't hackle movies while I'm actually in the theater, but it was <i>so hard.</i> When the heroine (did she have a name? I don't remember) kicked down the door to an abandoned building and discovered a table stacked with weapons and ammo, I couldn't help it.

"Aw, man! I've only got four slots free in my backpack! I've gotta drop a medkit!"

<a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> insists that he liked <i>Resident Evil 2</i> "for what it was." I will allow that statement to stand on its own. Anyone looking for a zombie-related film this week would do well to see <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>. It's a work of art -- true genius, a sly British romantic comedy shoved into the movie-blender with a survival horror flick and frapped.

In less zombie-related news, the weekend is fabulous thus far. Scampered out to Big Rock for lunch with <a href="http://delicateeffigy.livejournal.com">delicateeffigy</a> and a pleasant afternoon of used-bookstore-browsing, walking, lounging in the sun on her farm, and talking about bizarre, twisted themes in fiction. It's good to be in love.
