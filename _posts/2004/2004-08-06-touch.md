Over the past couple of weeks I've been thinking more and more about how touch-centric I can be. I walk into my office and every morning, it's the same thing. I realized that I always touch, running my fingertips along the wall as I walk. Under counter tops. Along the edges of desks, tracing the sides of picture frames.

As I walk in the double doors, into the lobby, it starts. Fingertips slide up the cool marble of the lobby wall, trace the circle of the elevator button, and I push. I duck in, still following the corner with my fingers, around the elevator doors. Onto the cool slick metal of the door's interior. As I leave, it's the faint pebbly touch of the wallpaper, interrupted by the rhythm of wooden trim. Cool glass doors. Metal handles, all curves and smooth edges. Wooden door frames, the leather arm of my chair, supple and easy. The plastic stretch of the keyboard. And then, work. And words.

I like it.
