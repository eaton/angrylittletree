Burboclaves, quantum entanglement, and genetic hacks. The future's old news -- now is where it's at.

<a href="http://www.freep.com/news/locway/detplan21e_20040921.htm">Detroit council OKs plan that touts racial separation</a> -- "The crux of the plan is the creation of a business district -- dubbed African Town -- that would be funded in part with city money and made up of black-owned businesses catering to a black clientele."

<a href="http://feed.proteinos.com/002270.html">Quantum Crypto</a> -- "The entangled-state system guaranteed that each bit of information was represented by just one photon, making it impossible for an eavesdropper to peek at the information without being detected. The entangled-state system is also perfectly random, making it impossible for an eavesdropper to gain information about the code by examining the equipment used."

<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3679848.stm">Safer route to gene therapy found</a> -- "Researchers have been looking at ways to treat diseases due to faulty genes, like cystic fibrosis, using gene therapy. For example, a gene could be added to replace a broken one. These 'therapeutic' genes then need to be controlled - switched on and off as required. Current methods used to control genes usually involve a complicated three-step process.... The new method involves inserting a special DNA sequence into the patient's own genes or into the therapeutic gene introduced by gene therapy."
