Here's a simple question. Does anyone know where I can find decent statistics on why employers are <b>NOT hiring workers at present</b>? I've heard conservatives say that it's because they're overtaxed, and tax breaks would alleviate the problem. I've heard liberals say that it's because the common man has no money to purchase goods. Neither has produced compelling statistics, just cartoony assertations.

Hard numbers! Where can I find them?
