<i><blockquote>"So, what's your fantasy?"
"You mean, the taking over Cuba, or the concubines with solid C# programming skills?"
"Ha ha."
"No, I'm dead serious. I'd totally pair program."
"A girl asks you a sexy question and you come back with Cuban programming concubines? You're fired."
"OK, fine. In my idealized, incredibly hot fatansy, I'm dating someone who is reasonably well adjusted and has not, in at least four weeks, had a hissing, screaming outburst and broken up with me because I gave her flowers."
"Hahahah. I'm laughing my ass off. You're awesome. I meant sexual fantasy, you dip."
"Seriously, I don't know. Lots of stuff could be wild and crazy. Doesn't come to mind when I think 'fantasy,' though."
"Come on. tying people up? Biting? Open spaces? Rough sex? Gentle sex?"
"OK, fine. First thing that always comes to mind is waking up curled up with someone I love, arms around their waist, cheek against the nape of their neck, sun coming in the window before they're awake."
"Oh, come on you whuss."
"Eh, just feels like I stopped bothering with sexual fantasies a while back. It's like shopping for locomotives. I'll focus on finding someone who I'd actually want a relationship with and also happens to want one with me."
"Hah. Shopping for locomotives. I like you."
"I could say 'Oh, sure, hot kinky sex with lots of leather and zippers and baby oil!' but it all seems kind of pointless to me if that underlying connection isn't there."
"Huh. No casual sex for you, I guess."
"Yeah. Looks that way."</blockquote></i>
