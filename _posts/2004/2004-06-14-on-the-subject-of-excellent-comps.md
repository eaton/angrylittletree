Got a swanky comp from <a href="http://edthechic.livejournal.com">edthechic</a>, and I am most certainly digging it. I'm shocked and ashamed that I've never heard anything by <i>Catherine Wheel</i> for so long. Their song <i>Sparks Are Gonna Fly</i> absolutely smokes, though. Very very catchy, hard edge, and a great hook. I approve.
