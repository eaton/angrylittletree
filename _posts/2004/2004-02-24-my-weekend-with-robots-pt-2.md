For those who read the first entry and want to hear about the actual battle... <!--break-->

As the battle lines were drawn, strategies formed. From the looks of it, <a href="http://ddukbokki.livejournal.com">ddukbokki</a> and <a href="http://ineedanewex.livejournal.com">ineedanewex</a> would be piling their infantry up the slope onto the plateau to defend the objective. The Fenrir Battle Armors would be especially dangerous -- with antipersonnel weapons, they'd be able to chew through my attacking infantry before I could touch the objective. Their heavy mechs were deployed on either side of the plateau in teams of two, and their was massed on one side for long range strikes. Tanks were being deployed on both sides of the objective, forming an interlocking series of kill zones around it.

On the attacking side, I needed to cover almost six feet of gaming surface in no more than nine or ten turns if I was to have enough time to drop infantry and keep them safe long enough to capture the objective. Speed would be critical: getting mired in a slugfest mid-board would burn time <i>and</i> leave me vulnerable to defending artillery. Although I was brinigng four snipers to the table, they had two Long Toms. With an additional foot of reach, they could pound me long before I was in range to strike back.

<b>The Battle Proper</b>

First off, I sent most of my fast attack choppers -- the Crow Scout and both Danai assault choppers -- to the left side of the battlefield along with one of the transport choppers. Escorted by the heavy transport on the ground, they were a serious threat to lightly armored defenders, but would have to defend on speed to get past heavy hitters.

On the right side, two of my transport choppers swept up, covered by the Merc Balac attack chopper. On the ground, both The Bounty Hunter and Gus Eddington charged forward. Those two heavy mechs would be the fist of the assault, taking 600 of my battlegroup's 1500 points. The Bounty Hunter's high defense and attack values, combined with a respectable speed of 8 and evade for heat-free running, would make it maneuverable enough to lead the attack, while Gus Eddington's jump jets would be critical once the plateau was reached. Hopefully, they would punch a hole through the defense while the transport choppers swept in.

Artillery strikes from the defenders came in almost immediately, and the advantage of the Long Toms over my Snipers was apparent. I wasn't able to get my snipers into striking position for almost 4 turns, while the Long Toms dropped strikes to slow my advance. <b><a href="http://ddukbokki.livejournal.com">ddukbokki</a>'s</b> unholy double-team -- Cynthia Kelly and One Eyed Jack -- went nose to nose with my two mechs almost immediately, though <a href="http://ddukbokki.livejournal.com">ddukbokki</a> had trouble striking at my all-VTOL assault on the left side.

By the fourth or fifth turn, things were starting to get ugly. I zipped in my Crow chopper as a sacrificial lamb, basing a Long Tom to cover a quick rush from artillery strikes, and got in a few quick hits before it was destroyed. On the left flank, my assault choppers held <b><a href="http://ineedanewex.livejournal.com">ineedanewex</a>'s</b> two mechs and tank at standoff range, but accomplished little. On the right side, the mech pileup got ugly. Retreating from a huge pounding of artillery, my two mechs lost ground and allowed One Eyed Jack to break loose and join the left flank. There, my threatened choppers wouldn't be able to defend the transport crawler. In a panic, it dumped its cargo: the Arrove IV artillery tank. The Arrow IV's long long reach put me just within striking distance of the objective plateau, and I fird off several quick volleys before OEJ could stomp it to pieces. Hopefully, I'd hit something important and soften his defense before the choppers dropped their infantry...
