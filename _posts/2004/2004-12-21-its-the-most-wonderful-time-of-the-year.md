Christmas is killing me.

Not completely, mind you, not terribly, but the cheery holiday music that plays nonstop in our office building is starting to claw its way behind my eyes and make me long for a whiffle-bat. The cathartic <em>whiff-BAP! whiff-BAP!</em> of plastic against co-worker would no doubt relieve this stress. Annoyance aside, it's really kind of creepy hearing all the songs about Santa Claus. My parents, wacky folks that they were, never bothered with trickery or subterfuge about the Guy In Red. They told me flat out that there was no Santa, that Christmas was a time when people who loved each other gave gifts to celebrate and bless each other, and that they wouldn't lie to me to perpetuate a cute traditional myth. At five or six, I was pretty cool with that -- I hadn't invested much in the idea to begin with.

So now, decades later, it's strange and surreal hearing pop songs and heartfelt country ballads asking <a href="http://www.lyricsfind.com/d/dolly-parton/unknown-album/i-believe-in-santa-claus.php">Santa Claus</a> to <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Santa-Bring-My-Baby-Back-to-Me-lyrics-Elvis-Presley/56F296B093C5B0DA482568740039F637">make Christmas happy</a>, protect loved ones, <a href="http://www.lyricsondemand.com/b/britneyspearslyrics/santacanuhearmelyrics.html">reunite lost lovers</a>... <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/toni-braxton/139069.html">whatever.</a> It's not new, really. But being forced to listen to Top Ten Christmas Hits all day gets me thinking, y'know?

In other news, I'm gnawing my hand in anticipation. Almost all of my gifts this year were ordered online -- while they are <em>supposed</em> to arrive by the 24th thanks to the wonders of two-day shipping and sneaky UPS Ground schedules, I'm hoping and praying that everything comes through okay. The next 72 hours will determine whether I have anything to wrap for Catherine, John, Jason, Mom, Dad, Catherine's family... um... Yeah, pretty much everyone. I hate malls. Hate 'em during the holidays! But there's one thing you can say for them... When you buy a gift at the mall, it's in your hands then and there.

I shall think about this for next year.

Randomness: <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">SharpReader</a> is my new favorite app. There are rough edges, naturally, but it's a swanky .Net-based RSS aggregator and feed reader. Clean and simple, it's a nice replacement for my old LiveJournal friends list. For ubergeekiness, I can also write little C# plugins to do post-processing on the feeds, filtering to my tastes, and so on. Quelle yummy.
