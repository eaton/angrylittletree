<a href="http://mitomi.livejournal.com">mitomi</a> is convinced that, with Boogedy and Louis gone, I need some kitten luvin' in my life. She keeps IMing me pictures of kittens, and googling for animal shelters in a five mile radius of my apartment.

"Kitties need looooove, Jeffie!" she says to me.

This is daunting. How can I argue with this face?
