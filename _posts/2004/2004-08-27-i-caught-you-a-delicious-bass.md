Lunch with Catherine yesterday -- a good, smiling happy thing that included alfredo sauce and jokes about Bono. How can you go wrong with that? Work has settled down slightly over the last couple of days, after a brief panic about some deadlines and a mad rush to get stuff finished up in time.

Saw <i>Napoleon Dynamite</i> last night. It's... very... yeaaaaah.

Wow.

Imagine, if you will, the mutant offspring of <i>Punch Drunk Love</i> and <i>Pretty In Pink</i>, raised to adulthood by Wes Anderson. All of the intense social awkwardness that PDL brought to the screen tempered with nostalgic teen-angst and Anderson's weirdly mellow comic twists. It's good -- very good, the more I think about it -- but it's almost impossible to explain why. Happy endings? Well... <i>kind of yes.</i> It's certainly not <i>bad,</i> and it's not inexplicably rain-of-frogs weird like <i>Magnolia</i> or something. But the film strikes such an odd, disconnected tone that even happy twists feel so strange and foreign, so unexpected compared to the standard formulas that always pop up on screen.

I liked it.
