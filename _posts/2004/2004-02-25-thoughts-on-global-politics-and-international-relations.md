There is a subtle but important difference between the following two statements:

"As part of an international coalition, we're going to bring freedom to a nation that's suffered under a brutal dictatorship for far too long."

"Holy shit, we fucked up and spent decades training and funding complete nutjobs because we thought they were anti-Communists during the 70s and 80s. Of the dozens of brutal regimes we helped build and prop up, we'll pick the one whose resident nutjobs pose the biggest embarassment. Then, we'll point to the human rights abuses we trained and equipped them to perpetuate at the School of the Americas, and bomb their home country into the 13th century. We'll bring a barrowful of third world countries along for the ride, promising them financial aid in exchange for their endorsement of our plans."

I mean, it's not even the sentiment that's so bad. Why can't our government just be honest about it?
