Even if I had my camera, it wouldn't to the moment justice.

A storm is rolling in, some tremendous severe thunderstorm that promises to pound the city with rain for a while. Right now, though, I'm stuck in the time-between-times that precedes the storm. To the east, dark thunderheads. To the west, a breathtaking golden sunset, with the silouhettes of clouds crisp against the pastels and the huge disc of the sun as it slides past the horizon. I look back at the thunderheads -- there's a rainbow, bright against the dark clouds, arcing its way from cloud to ground. Lightning arcs, jumping inside the cloud behind the rainbow.

Amazing.

And now, as I've typed, the sun dipped below the trees. I can see the sky growing darker, visibly, as I watch. Show's over, everyone...

Time to go home.
