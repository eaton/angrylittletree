My personal email address is a moniker I grabbed a few years ago -- <em>predicate.</em> Over the last few months, spammers finally found it and began bombarding me with offers for vicodin, larger reproductive organs, cheap software, and so on. It's the subject lines that get me, though. For some reason, they seem to think that including permutations of my own email address will make me think the mail is somehow <em>legit.</em> Thus far, I've been called:

Mr. Predican
Predication
Prediliction
Predi
Predpred
PREDIC!!

...and so on. Seriously, people. It's <em>predicate</em>. Predicate!
