My thoughts on the current administration's international policy (of which the particulars of war in Iraq are really only a manifestation) have been the subject of a few posts lately. The strange thing is, <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/3_1_04/cover.html" target="_blank">a recent op-ed piece by none other than Pat Buchannan</a> makes some of the same points, very clearly and simply. His review of <i>An End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror</i> is a solid rebuke of the Neoconservative presuppositions that the administration seems to be embracing.
<blockquote><i>To suggest Frum and Perle are over the top is not to imply we not take seriously the threat of terror attacks on airliners, in malls, from dirty bombs, or, God forbid, a crude atomic device smuggled in by Ryder truck or container ship. Yet even this will never “overthrow our civilization.”

...

In the war we are in, our enemies are weak. That is why they resort to the weapon of the weak—terror. And, as in the Cold War, time is on America’s side. Perseverance and patience are called for, not this panic.</i></blockquote>
While I disagree with some of the alternative solutions Buchannan subtly pushes ("cut off immigration! Get white birth statistics back up!") he does a great job of shredding the Neocon talking points.

Thoughts?
