Woke up this morning at 5:30 or so, heart pounding, disoriented as I realized that the previous minutes... hours? had only been a dream.

Things start fuzzy -- I'm somehow at my parents' house again, and there's some mention made of Mary, or Marie, or someone like that. I'm confused, because... well, Catherine? My girlfriend, my friend, all that? I get awkward looks from my parents and they remind me, gently, that that is <i>over</i>. That Catherine left, remember? I don't get what they're saying -- there's no memory, nothing. Just yesterday I was talking to her, what gives? Nothing makes sense.

I ask them what day it is, and they say it's the 17th of December. I have no recollection of anything since November -- not 'fuzzy memories,' just nothing. December never happened for me, and in that blank gap of memory everything fell apart. I try to call Catherine but people try to stop me, like this has happened before -- like I'm the guy from Memento, shocked every morning by events I should have come to accept.

Everything fell apart and I have no idea why.

That's when I woke up -- in my bed, heart pounding, sweating. Half-dark before sunrise. It took me minutes to realize it had only been a dream. Fuckin' December 17th.
