So I've taken the plunge and, for the first time in my life, created a <i>product</i> out of my photography. A 12-month 2005 Calendar of images I've taken over the past year. If anyone has thoughts or feeback on how it looks (or, hell, if you're in the market for a calendar... *grin*) click it and let me know what you think.

It's amazing how self-conscious I've become about my photography as time goes on -- it's silly, but the gut level reaction is there. Catherine and assorted friends have been encouraging me to get together an exhibit of some kind -- I have roughly 10,000 photos taken over the past year, and narrowing it down to 'The Really Good Stuff' yields about 300-400 images. Yowza.
