Oh, <em>hell</em> yes. Linked via <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/38035">MetaFilter</a>, it's <a href="http://www.djbc.net/mashes/beastles.html">Meet The Beastles</a>, an amazing mashup that makes The Grey Album look like slush. My opinion, of course. A lot of Beastie Boys stuff can be repetitive, despite the nostalgia. Splat it together with the Beatles, though -- awesome, classic melodies -- and you make the whole thing fly. It's good. Really. Seriously. And it'll probably be gone in a few days, so check it while you've got the chance.
