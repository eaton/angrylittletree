For some reason, today seems to be the day of the dolls for me. Friends, independently, keep sending URLs for twisted and unsettling merchandise of the bipedal variety. Naturally, I'm obligated to share:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/toys/B00005BM41/ref%3Dpd%5Fluc%5F32%5Flc%5Fa25x40/002-3825322-1486418" target="_blank">Barbie and Ken as Arwen and Aragorn</a>
Dear Jesus, make it stop. Who thought this was a good idea? Who? Although, admittedly, if a 'Barbie and Ken as Case and Molly from William Gibson's Neuromancer' set came out, I <i>would</i> be all over it. I'd feel dirty, though.

<a href="http://www.aquinasandmore.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/store.ItemDetails/SKU/17163/355F7480E31-65B8-D4D4-DC8DDA7AB84EA648.htm" target="_blank">Create-Your-Own Catholic School Girl Doll</a>
I really don't think this one needs any commentary. A friend IM'd me the URL, and we both sat in silence for a few moments before closing the window.

<a href="http://www.accoutrements.com/actionfigures/10898.html" target="_blank">Fuzz, The Hipster Doll</a>
Postmodernism has finally taken its toll. There are no heros, only molded plastic. If this guy gets an action figure, <i>I</i> want a Saturday mornign cartoon show with full merchandising tie-ins.
