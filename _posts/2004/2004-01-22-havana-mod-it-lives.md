Production on installment 3, the first full issue of <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/teaser.html" target="_blank">Havana Moderne</a>, has started again. We've come up with an interesting solution to the scenes that take place in VR, and there are a couple of cutaway shots we still have to take over the weekend. But things are coming together again. This issue will also be available in webcomic form and downloadable 'Full 16 page glory PDF' form. Booyah.

For the curious, here's a sample frame from the current production work... Further bulletins as events warrant.
