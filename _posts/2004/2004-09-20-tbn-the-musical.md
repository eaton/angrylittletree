OK, kids. <a href="http://www.tbn.org/index.php/8/1.html">The Trinity Broadcasting Network</a> now has dozens of television specials and full length movies (like Carman's tour de force <i>The Champion</i> and <i>The Omega Code</i> available for download. Thems that have the bandwidth? I expect fansubbed and MST3K'd versions of all of them to be available for my entertainment in no less than 72 hours.

That is all.
