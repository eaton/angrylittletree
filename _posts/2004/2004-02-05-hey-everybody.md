Things seem to be okay. Thanks so much for the outpouring of support and engouragement and prayers. I'm pretty far gone, as it's been about 18 hours since the phone call woke me up nad i'm just starting to get a chnace to slump and close my eyes.

Apparently things transpired like so.

My father, at some point last night, had a dream in which he lost his voice. When he woke up, he couldn't speak. My mother was alarmed, to say the least, and wasn't sure how to proceed. Was he dazed? Having a stroke? My father simply wouldn't respond to her questions, althouhg he was making eye contact, etc.

In the time that followed, phone calls were made and so on. Attempts at communication continued. An ambulance showed up. Around that time I was getting an early morning phone call from one of the friends that my mother had called. So, round-robin style, I got the news that there was a medical emergency of some kind. When I got there ,groggy and snow-encrusted, they were in the process of communicating via pen and paper: apparently my father was coherent, conscious, and able to answer questions without any problem -- save that he was mute.

He didn't want to take the ambulance to the hosiptal, but the EMTs asked me if I could make sure he got there, as Mom (being a mom, I guess) was ratcheting into higher and higher levels of stress-just-shy-of-panic with every passing moment. They piled into the car and I drove them. As the day progressed, strange fruitless tests followed and so on. Dad explained via palmpilot, while lying on a hospital gurney, that he could think clearly, but words simply wouldn't come. It was as if there was a conceptual bottleneck. Eventually I stumbled off to grab some coffee from the hospital cafeteria. Mom, in the meantime, tried to coach him throug hthe process of saying a word or so. By the time I got back, Dad was able to sound out a name.

Testing seems to have ruled out a stroke, and most of the usual suspects. Whil the doctors deliberated, Dad explained that he couldn't 'speak,' but by thinking the sounds of a word through, and sounding it out, he could 'say' words. Eventually he was moved into a room, and slowly but surely he practiced. More testing followed. Within a couple of hours he was working on sentences. Eventually, he spoke normally -- testing continued, though, and so on. I finally drove my mom home and all that, so she could get some rest and i could get a shower. Dad said he just wanted to go home and felt fine.

Late this evening he finally came home. The hospital wants him in for more rounds of testing, but they can't find anything wrong with him so far.

Thanks, everyone. I'm going to collapse now.
