The "Ask me anything" meme's been circulating again...

<blockquote><i>
"This is the problem with LJ, we all think we are so close, and we know nothing about each other. I want you to ask me something you think you should know about me. Something that should be obvious, but you have no idea about.

Then post this in your LJ and find out what people don't know about you."</i></blockquote>
