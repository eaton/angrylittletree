I remember one of my first encounters with metaphor-gone-wrong from my early teens. I was toying around with a yo-yo and it kept tangling up as I used it, spinning and wobbling when it should've zipped up and down. I stopped, unwound the string, and carefully untangled it. "You know," I said to my mother, "from this yo-yo's perspective everything is chaos right now. I've stopped it, and its very purpose for existing -- going up and down -- is in question. Little does the yo-yo know that I'm fixing it, making sure that it can do what it was meant to do even better than before. So much like us, as humans." We shared a chuckle, and I wound the yo-yo string up again. I promptly dropped it and it shattered, the pieces skittering around the floor. I paused.



"Of course, the metaphor could be taken too far."



I'm reminded of that as I make my thoughtful way through <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0939516519/viapositiva-20">Dogspell: A Dogmatic Theology on the Abounding Love of God</a></em> by Mary Ellen Ashcroft. It's a thin little book but a good one. She starts with a student's simple epiphany: "If I really believed that God loved me as much as my dog, it would change everything." She uses the metaphor to examine her own perceptions of God's love and character, mindful of the imperfect nature of the comparison. She never takes the metaphor too seriously, but she understands that as story-telling creatures, we <em>need</em> anchors and jumping-off-points to understand a concept as big and all-encompassing as God.



It's easy to pick holes in a metaphor, to find all the ways in which a comparison <em>isn't</em> apt. It's more difficult to capture an essential truth, to wrap it up in words or pictures and offer it to someone else. That's <em>via positiva</em> -- finding God in the connections, in the similarities, in the poetry and the metaphors and the parables that surround us. Far too often, when we want to understand God, we jump to <em>via negativa</em>. We take a knife to our ideas and slice out anything that doesn't pass orthodox muster. We prune and pare and cut and snip until all we're left with is a Hypothetically Perfect Abstract Deity who can only be touched through intellect-packed theological terms like <em>Infra-lapsarian</em> and <em>Theonomy</em>.



It's a very Enlightenment-era way to approach things, and there's certainly a sense of safety that comes with it. The reassuring precision of perfect definitions, clearly true or untrue. It's also a very dead approach, more comfortable in dictionaries and technical references than books about the Creator of the known universe.



Via Positiva requires both bravery and humility. Humility, because it requires a willingness to acknowledge the limitations of the pictures and words and tools we have to explain something bigger than we are. Bravery, because it requires the guts to jump in regardless, learning and growing and changing. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0939516519/viapositiva-20">Dogspell</a></em> has that flavor to it, and it's a refreshing one. Here's to <em>via positiva</em>, the poet's theology.
