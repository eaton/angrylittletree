After Sunday's photo outing, <a href="http://delicateeffigy.livejournal.com">delicateeffigy</a> and I scampered back to the apartment for dinner. I'd missed <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i> in theaters, though the premise was fascinating. Catherine borrowed the DVD from a friend and we curled up in front of the mighty plasma screen to enjoy it.

I really wasn't expecting the movie to hit me as hard as it did; the underlying themes of memory, regret, love, and pain are all very powerful, but the movie itself is real, true art. It's painful to watch in many places for all the right reasons. When it was over, though, I couldn't shake a sense of soul-eating sadness that I haven't felt for a year or so.

I spent a long time -- years -- experiencing a sort of pre-emptive painful regret. The dating that I did was interesting and enjoyable, the people that I met were intelligent and engaging. Good memories were made. But I never shook the sense of foreboding, that <i>Once Things Inevitably Broke Down And The Relationship Ended</i>, all those little pleasant memories would turn bitter. That's what memories do when they're recast in the light of new experiences, you know? The cute first few days of a relationship feels bitterly naive, almost deceptive, in the wake of a tumultuous breakup. Recalling those memories becomes a bitter thing in that light, good turned to bad.

I was always deathly afraid of that effect -- of the good burning to ash and leaving a bundle of sour memories. After The Infamous Breakup(tm) four years ago, I remember writing, asking, <i>Is this all it comes down to? Two people who know the perfect words to say, "I wish we never were?"</i>

It ate at me, tore at me for years. I coped first by pushing away good memories. When I found myself in one of those moments that you <i>know</i> you'll remember later, I would try to imagine it from the perspective of a post-breakup reminisce. Would this turn sour? Would it still be palatable? Needless to say, it was a tremendously, shockingly masochistic way to live. Eventually I managed to get past it by embracing a sort of devil-may-care existentialism regarding relationships. "So what if things don't work out? I'm sure they won't. Might as well make it an interesting trip." Etc. Etc. It was during that phase that I debuted my slogan: Fatalism Is The New Confidence.

Meeting Catherine was scary and different. She punched through a lot of those defenses, simply by being who she is. Loving the things that she loves and being honest and open about her heart and the things that matter to her. We clicked and we connected and before I knew it, it really really <i>mattered</i> to me.

I wasn't dragging myself through hypothetical breakup scenerios in order to pre-emptively steel myself against pain. I was doing things -- good things, expressing-love things -- that I knew would hurt if I remembered them after a breakup. Scary shit, that.

But it's worth it.

Catherine is worth it.

It took an hour or two of talking with her, wracking, sometimes-incomprehensible talking, as I tried to unravel what had shaken me up so much about that film. I don't know the future or what it holds. But I do know that anything worth calling Love <i>will</i> hurt if things don't work out. Because it's important. Because it matters.

Don't know if this post made any sense. But thank you, Catherine. I love you.
