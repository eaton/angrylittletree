Thanks to <a href="http://ebbtide.livejournal.com">ebbtide</a> for pointing out <a href="http://www.myfootprint.org/">this site...</a> It's sobering. I'm very curious to read how they come up with their numbers, and specifically what things can be done to reduce my footprint. Are there big "bang for your buck" areas like public transportation or electricity consumption?

<tt>CATEGORY  	ACRES
FOOD 	4.2
MOBILITY 	0.5
SHELTER 	6.2
GOODS/SERVICES 	5.9
TOTAL FOOTPRINT 	17

IN COMPARISON, THE AVERAGE ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT IN YOUR COUNTRY IS 24 ACRES PER PERSON.

WORLDWIDE, THERE EXIST 4.5 BIOLOGICALLY PRODUCTIVE ACRES PER PERSON.
	
IF EVERYONE LIVED LIKE YOU, WE WOULD NEED 3.8 PLANETS.</tt>
