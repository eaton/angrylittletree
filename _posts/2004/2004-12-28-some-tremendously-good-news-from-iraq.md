Juan Cole's <a href="http://www.juancole.com" target="_blank">Informed Comment</a> is one of my favorite spots for reasoned, balanced analysis of the situation in Iraq and the Middle East in general. While most would probably categorize him as liberal, his positions on Israel and Palestine, Mideast politics, terrorism, etc put him squarely in the "insightful realists" camp. He's pro-Israel and never cuts terrorists slack on theoretical grounds, but he's a stickler for honesty when assessing the motivations and goals of those who would oppose us.

He's been one of the "naysayers" about the Iraqi invasion for quite a while, noting the tremendously dire situation that the country is in and the "gift-wrapped" propaganda piece our country handed to Al Qaeda when we invaded. <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2004/12/bin-laden-votes-in-iraq-and-shoots.html" target="_blank">Today, though, he's on the money with his analysis of Bin Laden's latest video</a>.
<blockquote>Usamah Bin Laden's latest video was broadcast on al-Jazeera on Monday, in which he commanded Muslims to boycott the January 30 elections in Iraq, and expressed his approval of Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi....
.
Bin Laden's intervention in Iraq was ham-fisted and clumsy, and will benefit the United States and the Shiites enormously. Most Iraqi Muslims, Sunni or Shiite, dislike the Wahhabi branch of Islam prevalent in Saudi Arabia, and with which Bin Laden is associated. Nationalistic Iraqis will object to a foreigner interfering in their national affairs....
.
If Bin Laden had been politically clever, he would have phrased his message in the terms of Iraqi nationalism. By siding with the narrowest sliver of Sunni extremists, he denied himself any real impact. By adopting Zarqawi, who has killed many more Iraqis (especially Shiites) than he has Americans, he simply tarnishes his own image inside Iraq.
.
It appears that Bin Laden is so weak now that he is forced to play to his own base, of Saudi and Salafi jihadists, some of whom are volunteer guerrillas in Iraq. They are the only ones in Iraq who would be happy to see this particular videotape.</blockquote>

Juan Cole has a very good track record, and his criticisms of US policy in the area stand out from the crowd -- there are no Anti-Bush screeds, just level headed analysis with a very, very solid historical understanding of the region. When Juan Cole is encouraged by Bin Laden's ham-fistedness, it gives me something to cheer about.
