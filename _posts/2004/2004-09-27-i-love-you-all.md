Some mornings I wake up, and the world is perfect.

I have some of the best friends that a man can hope for, and I realize -- whenever I stop to look at the world around me -- that I'm truly blessed. You're good people. And I look at the things that you all do, the ways you grow, and learn, and create, and love, and I'm proud. Proud of you, proud to know you.

I see Benson, one of the smartest men I've ever known in my life, a genius who's saved companies with his skills but has never let it go to his head. Compassionate, passionate, willing to try and fall and learn and try again -- and grow stronger and wiser as he does. He listens, and when he does, you know that he really cares about what you're saying and what you're feeling. He's my friend.

Jason, one of my oldest friends. Through thick and thin and sunshine and shit. We've known each other since "havign a drivers license" was new and exciting. I remember when he wrote his first song, on a little four-track. He's got a CD deal now. He's a DJ. He makes music I'd buy at Borders. He's a grown man now -- soon to be a husband. Still a hell-raiser and a lunatic, but he's got a steel backbone and a strong, good heart. Gentle with those who're hurting, and honest about his own struggles and questions. Guileless. He's my friend.

Michael. Loki. One of my oldest net.friends, an agent provocateur in the online wastelands. Snarky and razor-witted, he feels deeply and feels truly. He cares and he believes. He's been kicked around by so many things for so many years, and it seems the sun's beginning to shine on him. Words can't begin to describe the joy I feel when he experiences genuine happiness. He's my friend.

Lou, the Italian ninja. The teddy bear with a huge heart, a huge laugh, and a .50cal sniper rifle. I haven't met a person who didn't love him the minute they met him -- enthusiasm and kindness and laughter and all the rest. I worry, so many times, that I unload on him, dumping woes and questions and worries on him as I hash through love and life. I don't think he knows how much of a support he's been. He's my friend.

Catherine. We laugh at how similar we are -- like we've been on the same treasure hunt for decades and only just crossed paths. Whip-smart, tender like skin, slow to speak and wise when she does. She reminds me -- teaches me? -- to rest, shows me how it's done. She shows me the beautiful things she's found and shares them. Life with her is good, a blessing and a challenge and a reward. Knowing her is like an inheritance. She's my friend. My girlfriend. I love her.

Mel. Conrad. Jessalyn. Jessiepie. Paul. Bev. Dana. Siri. Decker. Mike. Fur. Everyone. I miss more names than I include. I love you all. I'm proud of you. Thank you for being who you are and knowing me and being known.
