Mmmm. Huge LAN party last night with tons of UT2K4 goodness. We played until two in the morning -- the new Onslaught game type is absolutely brilliant. It's everything've ever wanted in a network action game. I need to get a new motherboard in my box, though, without question. The Celeron-with-no-AGP-slot is killing me here. Adding s'more RAM on the way over to the party did help, though. I'm rather amused that I actually swapped DIMMs on my box while we were traveling. It's funny. <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> and Justin and I were talking on the drive home -- we agreeed that  the most gratifying thing about a LAN party is hearing people around the room shout your name as a bitter invective when you're on a winning streak. Hah.

What we DID learn there was that <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> has gotten a heck of a lot better, and <a href="http://tunified.livejournal.com">tunified</a> is absolutely <i>godlike</i>. I think it was a rare game that <a href="http://tunified.livejournal.com">tunified</a> didn't come out on the top of the 16-player pile, with at least double the frags of the closest contender.

You rock, man.

Planning for the next several issues of <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/100-1/" target="_blank">100 Words</a> continues. <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> and I are trying to put together a tighter timeline/outline based on the stuff we've been brainstorming and recording. It's fun stuff.

In other news, I took the Beliefnet Religion Quiz again and came out an Orthodox Quaker. w00t!
