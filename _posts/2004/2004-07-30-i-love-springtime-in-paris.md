So this week has been a little loopy, what with the emergency call from our client on Tuesday evening. Our software, which runs every night to process point-of-sale data and shelf label information for grocery stores around the east coast, had suddenly started taking 20 times longer to run. Needless to say, that made it <i>useless.</i> Even worse, it made it useness on the <i>night the client was supposed to go live with our product.</i> Words like <i>suicide</i> were used by the client in frantic conversations during this period.

14 hours later, at 3:30 PM, I staggered home, having worked through the night. Problem solved. Client thrilled. <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> taking command. A victorious yet loopy grin on my face. Needless to say, my perception of time is a little goofy at the moment, but the CEO is happy and the client is happy Awwwww, yeah.

Slept for twenty minutes before Cat arrived and we watch Moulin Rouge -- a tremendously surreal movie I'd never seen before, perfect for watching on sleep deprivation!
