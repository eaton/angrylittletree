<img src="/files/lj-photos/users/verb/cstone/images/bushnell.jpg" width=250 height=199 alt="" align="right" hspace=10>So I queue up <i>Vegas</i> for the first time in ages, and the memories hit me like a brick. A pleasant, fuzzy brick with a smilie face painted on the side.

This is the CD we listened to during numerous <a href="http://www.predicate.org/users/verb/cstone" target="_blank">Cornerstone</a> road trips, cruising along the open Illinois highway, flat and straight for miles and miles, the bass pounding out of tiny distorted car speakers, wind howling through open windows of Jason's old Lancer.

Good times, good times.
