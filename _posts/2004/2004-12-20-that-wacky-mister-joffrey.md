Last night, Catherine and I celebrated her birthday early with a night out on the town. Scrumptious stir fry, excellent martinis (three cheers for the Jade Monkey!) and the Joffrey Ballet's performance of The Nutcracker. Catherine's been watching the PBS broadcast of the performance every Christmas since she was a teensy little girl, and I played Fritz in the Lincoln Elementary School 4th Grade Class version of The Nutcracker back in '86... So between the two of us, it's a story that's warm and cozy and familiar.



I've never been to a <em>ballet</em> performance before, so the whole event had a certain air of mystery. Mental snapshots of people in tutus and stories about ballerina eating disorders from Naomi Wolf books formed the entirety of my knowledge about the art form. Despite all my fears, though, it was really accessible and the crowd in attendance was a nice one. Lots of families, a few "art patron" types, and none of the urban hipster crowd. Catherine was bouncily excited, and her enthusiasm caught. We both had a lot of fun, and I've decided that everyone, at least once in their life, should dress up like a life-sized gingerbread man. Seriously.



Since no cameras were allowed, I've taken the liberty of recreating the evening in MS Paint. Enjoy!
