It is a well known fact that I am fond of robots, particularly multi-story robots that walk about, thundering, leaving Volkswagon-sized footprints in the turf while conducting their business. If they carry guns the size of small schoolbusses, all the better. in light of that fact, it should come as no shock to my friends that I've recently discovered two potent sources of Big-Crushy-Robot-Goodness. Transformers: Armada, and Front Mission 4, both for the PS2.

If you don't want to hear another word about these things, <lj-cut text="you should not click here.">you should not click here.

Hearing about a shiny new Transformers game last year filled me with fear and trepidation. I've see the raping and pillaging that's been done to  the Beloved Franchise -- I hardly recognize the weird new stuff that sits on shelves in Toys-R-Us bearing the Transformers name. Where are the ambulances that transform into medics? Where are the Walther P-38s that unfold into girl-hipped villains? The shelves are filled with Pokemon-robot-hybrids and Transformers that transform into apes. What's that, you ask? <i>Apes.</i>

But I read the reviews. And I cautiously peeked at screenshots. And last weekend I caved in and grabbed a copy. And oh, how lovely it is. Sure, it's got the weird Tomb-Raider-Meets-Oni control goofiness. Combat takes some serious getting used to, and simple things like jumping over a crevice without tumbling down like a klutzy five year old, well, all those things take <i>work</i> at first. But once you hit the groove, it's choice. The game has nothing to do with oldschool Transformers timelines, so don't expect to face Unicron in a final battle or something cool like that. But for the pure, simple joy of driving Optimus Prime through a crowd of Decepticons, using one as a ramp, transforming in midair, and landing in a theatrical slide while you turn to rifle the remainders down... well, I don't think there's any other game in town. They fly like bowling pins when you drive into them, my friends. <i>Bowling pins.</i>

Front Mission 4 is another matter entirely. For some reason, it had escaped my attention completely. Then yesterday I received an IM from none other than <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> explaining in no uncertain terms that I was morally obligated to walk over to my PS2, eject whatever game might happen to currently reside in it, press <i>reset,</i> and insert <i>this game</i> instead. I was not disappointed.

To say that Front Mission 4 is <i>fun</i> is to say that our sun is <i>warm</i> and the icy depths of space are <i>chilly.</i> As the first mission of the game unfolded in all of its turn-based glory, a warm feeling of peace and calm and goodness enveloped me. This feeling was the sense that all is as it should be in the world. As a tutorial explained the intricacies of the Mech customization system, pointing me towards options for re-detailing the paint job on that one mech's arm, I shivered happily. Front Mission 4 is Final Fantasy VII in all the ways that are good and wholesome. Instead of tweaking Materia and swords, though, you're swapping around Gauss rifles the size of schoolbusses and training your pilots to <i>aim for the Mech's legs, not the chest, and finish it off from a distance when they're down.</i>

You manage a team of them. These mechs, they  follow your commands. They blow things up and things try to blow them up. It is turn-based, liesurely and pleasurable -- somehow reminiscent of the feeling that the prettiest girl in class is smiling at <i>you</i> and only you at this very moment. A few blissful moments slid by as I played -- then I blinked, and realized it was 6 AM. But it's okay, see, because now that I've got Elsa's Mech chassis upgraded, she has the power plant to haul an extra chain gun, and her improved accuracy and speed gives her double damage with support from Zane's sniper rifle, which will really help her in the next mission, where terrain will probably keep the long range missiles from being too effective, and... and... well. You get the idea.
