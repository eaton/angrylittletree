I've been trotting around for a week now with little snippets of stuff in my iPaq, waiting to be posted. But when? When will these orphaned bits of prose and introspection see the light of freedom? When?

Today, my friend. Today is that day.

Christmas was good to me, and I received a swanky new iPaq 1945 with all the trimmings. I'd been using an older Sony Clie for close to two years, but it was starting to show its age and I was chomping at the bit to compile my own PocketWindows apps. After all, who knows how to organize my grocery list better than I? No one, that's who. So, I'm rolling my own in C#. We'll see how it turns out.

Seriously, though, the iPaq rocks my socks. Although the software selection doesn't seem to be as broad as the Palm world (fewer goofy novelty games, etc), it's very slick. The things it <i>does</i> offer more than make up for the lack. Apparently, if I'm so inclined I can get Age of Empires II for it. Let that sink in for a moment, people... A sprawling epic-spanning realtime strategy game. Complete with music, spiffy graphics, and so on. On my palmtop. It's sick and wrong, I know.

It's even worse if I pop in the miniature WiFi card -- I can listen to MP3s streamed from our network server. It's like having a walkman with 14,000 songs in it that can play Tetris and send Instant Messages. At the moment I'm making do with a nice open-source implementation of Go, and downloaded copies of Nietzsche's <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>, and <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>. The screen's a little small for reading at the point sizes that Microsoft Reader supports; I wish it would let me notch they type down a few sizes. Screw readability, I know what I'm doing! Let me squint!

I started the photography course at COD; I was pleasantly startled by the makeup of the class. It's all post-college folks ranging from mid-20's to mid-50's. Most have done some photography, some are new, some are looking to get more experience. The instructor is an oldschool guy who's done freelance and staff photography for magazines since the 60's. He's got tons of experience and avoids the Photography Instructor Cliches of art-obsession and perfection-obsession. Stresses the basics, insists that everyone know what their camera's doing before they're allowed to turn on automatic features, but also stresses the importance of having fun capturing images.

I pulled out the old war horse for the class, since <i>Actual Honest To God Film</i> is required. Turns out the old Canon AE-1 is perfect for the class, since it doesn't even offer automatic features. Focus? Manual. White balance? Manual. F-stop? Manual. Film speed? Manual. Shutter speed? Well, you get the picture.  I feel very badass using it, like a ninja who eschews modern tools and relies on shuriken and a quick wit. Admittedly, though, the need to finish <i>an entire roll</i> and <i>have it developed</i> before I can see how things turned out... well, that's just killing me.

And finally, in other news, The Crystal Method's new release is absofreakinglutely amazing. Words fail me. If you listened to Tweakend, and enjoyed it, imagine that CD as a demo tape for this release. The first three tracks own me;. There's a hint of Underworld vibe on the first song, as if <i>Skyscraper, I Love You</i> were frapped into a copy of <i>Name of the Game.</i>  I approve.
