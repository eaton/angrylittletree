Oh, man.

Oh man oh man oh man. I was reading through <a href="http://transit_monger.livejournal.com">transit_monger</a>'s journal after a conversation in someone else's comments page. Very interesting stuff, with lots of interesting analysis of econ and transportation trends. Among other things, it links to <img src="http://www.nationmaster.com/facts.php" alt="Nationmaster">, a do-it-yourself slice and dice statistics analysis engine. Want to find out the most violent nation per capita? Choose the relevant statistics and out comes a graph. Want to find out the five developed nations with the lowest levels of consumer debt? No problem.

The stats aren't all super recent (getting handgun death statistics from Hungary, for example, must've been fun -- the numbers are 1995 era) but it's definitely a fabulous tool for doing some quick and dirty sanity checking during research or discussion.

Check it out, yo.

The guy's personal journal is pretty cool, too. Witness <img src="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jdarius/9223.html" alt="this amusing post"> -- startup hijinks AND nanotechnology, in one post. Money!
