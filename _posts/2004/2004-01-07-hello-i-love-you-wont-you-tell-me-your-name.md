Well.

It's 2004, isn't it? Time flies when you're having fun. 2003 was a real kicker of a year, with a lot of personal growth... a lot of pain and disappointment... a lot of really amazing positive developments. An intense year. When the new year turned over and 2004 had settled in, though, I was left with three things:
<ol>
<li> I like the person I'm becoming, and want to continue on the path I'm on. </li>
<li> I want to "be with someone," or whatever strange descriptor is currently used for a romantic relationship.</li>
<li> Being and becoming the person I want to be is more important to me than being with someone. </li>
</ol>
There's a lot of subtlety to those things, and the interaction between them is sometimes thorny. But hey, that's life.

<lj-cut text="Chapter Two: Wherein Our Hero Recounts The Events of the Holidays">Christmas was a good time spent with family and some friends. I've always been terrible about giving gifts. As in, I want to give them to people around September or so instead of waiting until Christmas. I really enjoy hunting around and finding gifts that really click with a person's personality. The stuff that akes them light up, yes? Yes. A random conversation with <a href="http://rdecker.livejournal.com">rdecker</a> a few weeks ago left me with a strange, bewildering comment. She said that I'm one of the best gift-givers she's ever known. that I will pull stuff out of nowhere that's based on comments or interests or old childhood memories that people don't even remember <i>mentioning</i> to me. That it's a real blessing to the people who get them. It left me vageuly off-balance and tongue tied, in a good way. I'm used to the qualities I put a lot of work into, the things I really value, being relatively unnoticed. They tend to be internal things, motivations, rather than frequently noticed things. Having someone I know and care about and respect not only notice, but call attention to it and express appreciation, was a really startling encouragement.

My date for New Years Eve fell though at the last minute, which was disappointing. That leaves my lifetime achievement record at '12 unsuccessful attempts to ask women out.' These days they tend to say yes, then vanish or something like that. One of my goals for 2004 is to actually go out on a date with someone. It's a matter of principle at this point, like the Bears winning the last game of the season.

Instead, I headed out to the city with <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> for the epic party at Finelady Manor. Many photos of the event are posted in my previous entries. Many, many people were there and it was cool to meet some new faces. Some of the folks on my friends list (Hey, <a href="http://wishthesame.livejournal.com">wishthesame</a>!) that I'd never met were there and it was fun putting faces with words. Getting a chance to talk to <a href="http://nicestems.livejournal.com">nicestems</a> for a while was also good. I've seen her LJ before, and we've met once or twice in passing, but she's a cool gal and I'm quite shocked I didn't get to know her earlier. Needless to say, she's now on The Hip List.

A triumphant return to work followed on Friday, along with mad dashing from store to get supplies for a <i>second</i> 2004 party at our apartment. It's the first party I've hosted in my new place, and while it was stressful, I enjoyed it a lot. I'll be doing it again, I'm sure. Several disparate groups of friends that normally don't come into contact with each other were all there, and the collision of worlds was interesting to say the least. 

And now? Well. Not much. I'm getting back into the swing of things at work, recovering from the celebrations, and settling in for the new year. On a whim, I signed up for a class at the local community college. Next week I'll be starting a photography workshop, and I'm really looking forward to it. I've decided that this year, I'm going to have at least one class going throughout the year. After the photography stuff finishes up, I've got my eye on Intro to Sociology...

We'll see how it turns out...
