When I was a toddler and yet to be toilet-trained, I was apparently a little hellion. Easily distracted, among other things. In the interest of preserving sanity while my parents trained me to use the <em>chair thing</em> instead of a diaper, my grandmother suggested they give me something to keep me distracted. To keep me from scampering around buck naked. A book, she suggested. Or a graham cracker.

A few months ago, a quarter of a century after that fateful day, I cleaned my room and found about seventy-five books hidden in corners, nooks, and crannies. I have to go buy a new bookshelf, now -- the old ones are full, see... And there are new books coming out! This week! This very day, perhaps! Looking back, I can't help but think that my parents' decision to hand me a book instead of a graham cracker was a very fateful one.

In other news, I keep forgetting to eat meals.
