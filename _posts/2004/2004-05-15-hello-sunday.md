It's been a long, long time -- there were a few gasping, panting collapses and some rusty tactics. But after a few rounds we all fell back into place and things started clicking. Lost 4-5 on a terribly close toussle for the frisbee in the end zone. A good game, played hard by all. I forgot how much I really love it -- I've got bruises from blocking throws, scrapes and stains from dives and falls, and my legs feel like I ran a few miles.<img src="/files/lj-photos/deckerspooner.jpg" width=200 height=150 alt="" align="left" hspace=10> Which I might well have, considering how much ground we covered as the frisbee changed hands. But ah, what a rush. We need to do it regularly -- this time, ew've got a good field nearby and it's early in the season.

After our bones knit, we popped downtown (Naperville, that is) for dinner, and then hit a movie. 

<i>Troy</i> was a better than I expected -- a decent Love-Honor-War epic, but a terribly bad adaptation of Greek mythology. The film went out of its way to paint a picture of Greek Gods as stone statues, nonexistant and/or unwilling to act. The point is driven home, over and over, that the people who believe in The Gods are ignorant dupes. Whether you believe that or not, it's impossible to avoid the fact that <i>The Illiad</i> and <i>The Odessey</i> take the Gods as a given in the structure of the story: Why is Achilles undefeatable? Well, he's... just... <i>good,</i> see, at what he does. You know. Really good. At killing things. Nevermind the whole dipping him in the river business. Never mind the whole son of a god bit. And ultimately he's shot in the ankle -- more a tip of the hat to the original story than anything else.

But, ah well. It wasn't that bad. And I can't imagine many people realizing the subtleties - when night fell in Troy, and the horse opened, revealing a mess of Spartans? The lady sitting next to me <i>gasped in shock.</i> I'm not quite sure how to say this, but... er... <i>The Trojan Horse</i> isn't an unexpected plot twist at this point...
