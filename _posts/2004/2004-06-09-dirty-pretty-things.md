<a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0001772/2004/06/07.html" target="_blank">Real Live Preacher</a> is one of the blogs that I try to keep up on regularly. The writing is sometimes funny, sometimes achingly beautiful, and always has the ring of heartfelt honesty to it. The writer (A Real Live Preacher) is up-front about his own fears, failings, and struggles. Not just the stereotypical token 'sins' but the real stuff -- grappling with doubts and depression and questions of <i>can I keep on doing this?</i>

<a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0001772/2004/06/07.html" target="_blank">Today's entry</a> is one of a series, in which he talks about a friend of his who left the ministry several years ago. The latest recounts the friend's bus trip to New Orleans after leaving the ministry, a sea-change trip to Mardi Gras, an attempt to get away from it all and escape depression. It captures something painfully sad and beautiful. Captures the essence of <i>goodness in the heart</i>, where something as simple as picking up a baby bottle is a profound manifestation of <i>who we are</i> as people.
