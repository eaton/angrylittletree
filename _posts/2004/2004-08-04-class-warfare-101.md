Since the early days of the campaign, <a href="http://www.georgewbush.com/blog/archives/week_2004_08_01.html#001385">President Bush has had a weblog.</a> It's a corporate/candidate style weblog, written in the chatty-but-anonymous style of marketing material that wants desperately to be real. There's nothing wrong with that, per se, but a post today hilighted the class warfare language that's part and parcel of the current Administration's message.

The text was <i>quoted from a message board</i> rather than written by a campaign staffer -- but the choice to post the text is telling. It's the message that they want at the core of the campaign.

<i><blockquote>Cops and firefighters are, if the women in the ranks will forgive the expression, Regular Guys. They drink beer, not wine, and certainly not French wine. They played football and baseball in high school, not lacrosse... Regular Guys do not blame Secret Service agents (who are Regular Guys) for knocking them down on the ski slopes, especially when those agents are there to take bullets for them. And Regular Guys relate to and prefer the company of other Regular Guys; they do not invite people like Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Affleck to their conventions....

You're going to see lots of those yellow [Firefighters For Kerry] t-shirts between now and election day, but don't be taken in. Like most cops, most firefighters will be voting for President Bush in November. You should be a Regular Guy and vote for him too.</blockquote></i> 

The original version of the post included more nasty language, accusing pro-Kerry firefighters of being out of shape wannabees who never fight <i>real</i> fires, just hang out at BBQ's and tell stories. That portion was pulled from the Bush blog pretty quickly, but the above text remains.

The Bush administration is filled with tremendously wealthy, privileged individuals from the President on down. Is having a candidate  rubbing shoulders with Ben Affleck at a convention any better or worse than having a President who rubs shoulders with criminal millionaires, ala Haliburton and Enron officials? Bush purchased his much-talked-about Texas ranch just in time for the 2000 presidential campaign, and made heavy use of it to establish his cowboy image. Until then, he'd been a failed oil-company executive turned state governor. His family is tremendously wealthy, deeply involved in national politics for generations. These are not "regular guy things." 

Are those reasons not to support Bush? No. Any attempt to spin them as such would be ignoring the real, substantive issues of what makes a good president. The same applies to these "Kerry is a poofy wine-drinker" posts. My concerns about Bush stem from the decisions he's made in office and the ideologies he's followed when the rubber meets the road. Playing class-warfare, implying that <i>real men</i> will vote for Bush, and calling into question the "Guy-ness" of those who support Kerry makes me sad. It's an opportunistic attempt to exploit at our society's fucked up Hemmingway-driven ideas of masculinity.

I'm sure it will work well.
