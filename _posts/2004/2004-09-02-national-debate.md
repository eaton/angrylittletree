Part of the trickiness about politics in our country seems to be that everything devolves into meta-debate about debate. "Negative Ads" are bad, so campaigns focus on portraying other candidates as "The Kind Of People Who Make Negative Ads." It's like playing three dimensional chess to decide who gets to go first in checkers.

<a href="http://www.instapundit.com/">Glenn Reynolds from Instapundit</a> posted some comments after last night's RNC speech that remind me of this. Glenn, while I disagree with many of his views, is a thoughtful, intelligent writer who's been on the blogging scene for quite some time. I believe that he's throwing up a straw man, though -- one that might not even be intentional, as dominant as it is in the public memespace.

<i><blockquote>We're told that people aren't supposed to criticize Kerry's Vietnam or post-Vietnam antiwar actions because doing that is a "smear," so if you can't talk about his Senate votes either, what's left? His time as Lieutenant Governor? Kerry's defenders seem a bit quick to call any kind of criticism unfair.</blockquote></i>

While there may be some who feel that way, I don't think it's the real issue. Let's look at the issues Glenn mentioned:

Criticizing Kerry's actions in Vietnam is certainly valid. <i>Swift Boat Veterans for Truth</i>, though -- the group that's been on the attack for the past couple of months -- has fabricated charges against Kerry. The problem with that group isn't that they're questioning Kerry's service. It's that they're lying about it boldly and brazenly, even going so far as to use the names of other veterans without permission in their "petition against Kerry."

Questions about Kerry's anti-war activities after returning from Vietnam are perfectly fine. But lies are not. Numerous pundits and commentators have said that Kerry 'accused innocent veterans of atrocities' -- but the atrocities he spoke out against in the 70's are now proven fact. He said they happened, not that all veterans had participated. It's not a smear to disagree with what he did, but it is a smear to lie about what he did. The Swift Boat Vets for Truth organization is also behind many of these accusations, but they seem not to have come to grips with the fact that Kerry was telling the truth in his 70's testimony.

Regarding his senate voting record, that's absolutely fair game. Again, though, most of the claims that have been tossed out have been very distorted. Particularly regarding Kerry's Tax record and Defense record. <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/">FactCheck.Org</a> has been doing a great job, along with <a href="http://www.spinsanity.org">Spinsanity</a>, of digging into the claims made by both Kerry and Bush in various ads and press releases.

If calling people on lies and distortions (rather than differences of philosophies and visions) means there's nothing left to object to, that's scary. I'm adamantly anti-Bush, but I <i>know</i> there are reasons to oppose Kerry based on honest, truthful dialogue rather than Machiavellian politicking.
