Max Lucado has long been one of my favorite Christian writers. He's not a scholarly researcher -- just a pastor and writer with a passion for communicating God's love to people. Even got a chance to interview him for my zine a decade or so ago, and it was a great experience.

I've always respected his singular focus on that goal -- he's never, as far as I could tell, been sidetracked by political agendas, controversies, or theological fads. When I heard that he delivered one of the benedictions at the Republican National Convention on August 31st, I did a double-take. The spirit of his work over the past several decades is the polar opposite of the spirit of accusation, fear, and opression that I honestly believe characterizes much of our nation's political process.

Then, I read the text of the benediction.

<blockquote><i>Remind us, oh Lord, that you do not exist to bless America. We exist to bless you. Remind us of your unquenchable, unconditional love. Affirm us when we seek your will, forgive and correct us, when we don't. Speak to us about the brevity of this life and the beauty of the next. And, most of all, prepare our souls for the moment we meet You face to face. We lay this election before you. And, in the end, Thy will be done.</i></blockquote>

Powerful words -- for all of us, regardless of our political views.
