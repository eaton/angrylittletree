Slowly but surely, I find myself turning into one of those annoying people. You know -- the ones who walk with a spring in their step. The ones who drift off at odd moments, wearing distantly goofy smiles.

It's been four months and some change since Catherine and I met. It's so strange sometimes, so out of step with all of my past experiences -- so deep-down <i>good</i> to be with her. Apparently this is what it's like to be "healthy," with communication and growing trust and respect and the willingness to work through issues rather than pretending they don't exist until they explode.

Do I sound mellow? I am. It's a good sort of feeling -- like being out in the sun for the afternoon with a good book. A good <i>thick</i> book with lots of characterization and some great action bits, and lots of interesting and subtle themes that you can go back and ponder again and again while you savor your favorite parts.

Some mornings I wake up amazed. I love you, Catherine. Knowing you is a blessing.
