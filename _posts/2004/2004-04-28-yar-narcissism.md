So, all the cool kids are doing these <i>surveys</i> and things. I figure, why not? I'll give it a shot. Please reply in comments and post your answers. If there's anything terribly incriminating or bad, it's there because I haven't bothered reading all the questions yet. Posting it is an act of daring. Thank you.

<a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a>, if you don't say I'm hot, I'll cry.

<i>ADDENDUM: You know, I was really serious when I said that I hadn't read all of the questions on that quiz when I posted it. After giving a closer look, I think I should never ever do that again. Consider the above questions redacted.

Really, seriously, I copied it from someone else's LJ before filling it out. I swear.

Cough.</i>
