So the Panasonic Plasma screen I had ordered is suddenly "out of stock" and won't be in stock for several weeks. They've offered to switch the TV being ordered to a Phillips 42FD9935, a similar TV that has had nice reviews but doesn't come in swanky black. Pity, that.

Anyone have opinions on this? Should I just cancel the order, and bide my time?

The Phillips seems to get fine reviews as well. Perhaps I'll swing by Best Buy and stare at it thoughtfully for a few minutes.
