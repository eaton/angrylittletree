<blockquote><i>TIME
Critics throw out so many charges against the President. Is there any one that you found the most unfair?
BUSH
I think they're all very unfair. [Laughter.] I really do.

TIME
Do you think these swift-boat ads are unfair to John Kerry?
BUSH
Do I think they're unfair? Not really. There have been millions of terrible ads against my husband.</i></blockquote>


Three cheers for insightful political analysis by the First Lady. Criticism of the president is all unfair -- but criticism of his opponent is fair, because others have criticised the president.

Sadly, the <i>truth</i> of the criticisms on either side goes unquestioned by most of the media. Allowing both "sides" to say their piece is considered objectivity. When the two sides disagree, there's no attempt made to discover the truth -- only to pit the sides against each other. The result? A giant echo-chamber of talking points and spin.

True charges are fair, untrue charges aren't -- it's as simple as that.
