I've been digging through the archives of my old livejournal and extracting some of the really choice links that I posted but never added to my voluminous bookmarks file. One of the winners is <a href="http://www.jacana.org.uk/pattern/P0.htm">A Pattern Language</a>, an online version of Christopher Alexander's architectural patterns. It's definitely influencing the way I look at living spaces and interior layout for my next apartment/condo/house/whatever. Pattern 79, <a href="http://www.jacana.org.uk/pattern/P79.htm">Your Own Home</a>, reminded me of Catherine. It emphasizes the psychological need for a garden in each home.  Interesting stuff!

Other news? Crafty gearheads are pushing typography on the web into the 21st century with swanky Flash hacks. <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2004/08/sifr">'Scalable IFR'</a> is the name for a technique that preserves god-blessed XHTML while shuffling in cool, anti aliased flash text whenever headlines or pull quotes are needed. Very very cool. I'll have to see if I can tinker around with it and make it work here.
