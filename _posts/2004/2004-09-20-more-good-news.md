<i><blockquote><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/09/20/britain.allawi/index.html">Interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi is warning that "terrorists" are flooding into Iraq from across the Muslim world. "Terrorists are coming and pouring in from various countries into Iraq to try and undermine the situation in Iraq," Allawi said. Meanwhile, two Americans and a Briton face beheading by kidnappers demanding the release of female prisoners.</a></blockquote></i>

The fact that Iraq is heating up leads to two basic theories at the moment.

First, <b>The Flypaper Theory</b>. This line of thinking holds that militant radicals are hopping over to Iraq to fight US troops instead of bombing buildings in other parts of the world. It's a good thing -- we're drawing them into our kind of fight, where out military can smash them far from our shores. There is a relatively fixed pool of terrorists and mlitants, and once we've defeated them, moderate voices in the country will have a platform and democracy will flourish.

Second, <b>the Christmas Present Theory</b>. According to this view, we destabilized Iraq by invading and gave militant radicals a perfect recruiting tool: a foreign power occupying their religion's second holiest place. Every time we respond to attacks with disproportionate force, killing and injuring civilians, we alienate more moderate Muslims. As more and more become alienated and enraged, the pool of radicals grows and the world becomes more dangerous. Iraq is our "Christmas Present" to Al Qaeda -- a training ground, recruiting pool, and propaganda piece all rolled into one.

As much as I'd like to believe the first option, I believe that it completely ignores the basics of Muslim culture and history. In addition, it naively ignores one of the core goals of terrorism -- to inspire a disproportionate response from the stronger opponent, thus alienating moderates who see the stronger power abusing innocents. Clearly, you say, moderates realize the terrorists <i>started</i> this all. Right? Maybe. We invaded on moral grounds -- if we don't hold ourselves to terribly high standards, we'll be called out as double-talking hypocrites. In fact, we already have been by most of the Muslim world.

It's a shitty situation to be in -- but that's the burden of being <i>the good guys.</i> We have to figure out better ways to solve the problems than leveling towns and issuing free-fire orders. Once you put on the white hat, you'd better live up to it.

In some ways, that's the challenge that I believe I face as a Christian every day. Opression -- whether personal, economic, military, or otherwise, always seems like an <i>effective</i> strategy in the immediate observable ways. As a follower of Christ, though, I'm called to put down those tools. It feels dangerous, many times. If I don't play hardball at the office, will a steely-eyed coworker take advantage of my 'weakness' to get ahead? Quite possibly. I believe that in the long run, pursuing peace bears dividens. But it's not a direct cause-and-effect link. Many times I will get shafted for it. Is the long-term goal (living a peaceful life) worth taking short term hits? Is there a middle ground? Yes, and yes. But it will always require a willingness to see peace, goodness, and love as the desired goal. And it will always require a willingness to put down the tools of opression and be vulnerable.
