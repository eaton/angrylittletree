Von at Obsidian Wings posts a <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2004/12/once_more_on_me.html">sharp, concise analysis</a> of the whole "Liberals are attacking Christmas when someone says 'Happy Holidays'" meme. According to a number of vocal national commentators, the trend of businesses saying "Happy Holidays" instead of "Merry Christmas" is part of a greater trend of Political Correctness, a skirmish in the war against traditional values. Von hits this one out of the park:
<blockquote>My beef with the purportedly world-weary Lileks is that he implies some secret history when there is only the world.  If he's pissed/bothered/annoyedly observant about how businesses have de-Christmasized Christmas over the past 40 years, put the blame where it belongs:  on the businesses.  Or, more properly, on capitalism.</blockquote>

It's worth asking how many of the national voices decrying this attack on Christmas also believe that the free market's invisible hand is the solution to <em>other</em> problems. I'd argue that many other cultural issues we face are negatively impacted by the pure-profit motive of unfettered capitalism. I'm no communist, but there <em>must</em> be deeper, more sustaining values for a culture if it's to survive.
