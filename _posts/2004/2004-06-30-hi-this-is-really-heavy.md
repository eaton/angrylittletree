So <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> and I saw the midnight showing of <i>Spiderman 2</i>. We were both thoroughly pwned. There was gratuitous science handwaving and a few parts where too much plot was crammed in between VERY solid stretches of great character development... but oh, man.

This movie <i>rocks.</i> Going to go see it again tonight with the Fusion crew, oh yes.
