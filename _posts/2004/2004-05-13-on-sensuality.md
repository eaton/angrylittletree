Earlier this week, someone was looking through the Top Ten List of things I say I'm looking for in a hypothetical woman for a hypothetical relationship. (It's less of a shopping list, really, and more of a set of filtering criteria -- but that's another matter.) Number seven or eight, I believe, is Must be a sensual person. <i>What,</i> asked the person I was talking to, <i>does this mean? Is it a code-word for sexy? Is it a polite way of saying, 'She has to be randy?' As a Christian, how do you resolve that desire for a 'sensual' person with calls for holiness in the Bible?</i>

This raises interesting questions for me -- ones that go way beyond relationship issues and cut deep into what it means to be a Christian and a human being.

What <i>is</i> sensuality?

I believe that we were created to enjoy a huge range of experiences -- to receive pleasure from every source. Standing on the beach at 7:35 in the evening, surfe spraying over your feet, sand crunching under your heels, the sun setting and painting the sky a golden yellow? That's a sensual experience. Tasting key lime pie, smelling salty sea-air, and rubbing a rose petal between your fingers until it bruises and wets your skin, feeling the hit of deep bass in your lungs? Those are all deeply sensual experiences.

There's no denying that <i>sexuality</i> is closely tied to <i>sensuality</i> as well. I think that's where a lot of the suspicion has come inside of the Church. Yes, Christians generally hold that premarital sex is something that doesn't jibe with their moral framework. Does that make all <i>sensual experiences</i> suspect, though? No. I would argue that the only way one can <i>be</i> a healthy sexual being, ready to enter into a relationship where sex is appropriate, is to be an inherently sensual person. Learn to enjoy all of those senses. Relish them. We were created with them for a reason.

When we pretend that <i>sensuality</i> is immoral, we confuse <i>all senses</i> with sex and confuse a state of being with an act of the heart. I <i>am</i> a sexual person, even when I'm not having sex. When we blur the two, Christians are only contributing to the sex-obsession that we complain pervades popular culture. 

<blockquote><I>Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: "Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!"?  These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.</I>
Col 2:20-23</blockquote>

<blockquote><I>You must no longer live as the Gentiles do....  Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.</I>
Eph 4:17-19</blockquote>

Both verses paint a different picture than the one we might expect of Scripture -- they warn against the danger of "giving one's self over" and "lack of restraint," not of sensuality itself. The experience of a tremendous sunset <i>is</i> a consuming thing, one that engages my entire being as I experience it. This, I believe, is what I was created for -- not a halfhearted suspicious experience of Creation. Like any good things, though, they become idols if I allow the pursuit of those pleasures to consume my life.

Anyhow. That's random.
