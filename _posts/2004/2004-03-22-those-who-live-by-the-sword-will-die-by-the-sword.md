So, <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/511378.html" target="_blank">Israel assassinated Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the leader of Hamas</a>. I can't say that I don't sympathize with their decision on a tactical level. He was  the founder and leader of a terrorist organization dedicated to destroying their country, and Hamas has made a name for itself blowing up civilians all over the nation. But really... Is taking the man out with a guided missile while his aides push his wheelchair down the street really going to solve the problem? From a tactical standpoint, yes, he's the leader of Hamas and the organization has been damaged. But when you step back and look at it, the incident is more of the same. Just another few degrees in the circle of violence, retribution and bitterness that marks Israel's conflicts with Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world. Living by the sword -- it's something that everyone in the region seems to be doing now. Yassin used terror and murder to further his goals, and he eventually met his end. Israel has responded to attacks with force, and quickly -- and the conflict intensifies. I don't know what the answer is, but it pains me to watch the cycle repeat itself, over and over.
