Last week I was poking at my Livejournal style, annoyed that it didn't provide decent style sheet support, had some grungy HTML, and so on and so forth.

So, y'know. I coded my own style sheet and did a bunch of CSS twiddling. You can see the results (still VERY much in progress) at <a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a>. The fun part is that ALL positioning, layout, formatting, etc is done using the style sheets. Not a single table. Not a single font tag.

While I was mucking in the S2 style system I added support for optional sidebars of book, music, and movie links... a random quote of the day generator, and other wackiness. It's still verrrrry hacky, and will be changing -- in particular, other viewtypes like 'Archive View' and 'Comments' need to be finished. If anyone's interested in using it to help with testing etc, though, drop me a line. Woo woo.

Yes.

I am a terrible, terrible geek.
