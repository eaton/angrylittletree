It's a long running joke that I'm bad (and I mean REALLY bad) about picking up random objects and pacing around the apartment/house/etc with them while I'm thinking or talking. It wouldn't be a problem if I remembered to put them down where I picked them up. But, no. They're deposited at random in strange locations, baffling all who seek said objects.

Today, while grabbing aa microwave dinner for lunch, I realized the seriousness of the problem. For some reason, I'd left a Sharpie in the freezer. It seems to still work, but... no, there's just no good excuse for that.

[ Update: 1:30 PM ]

I also spilled lasagna on myself, and only noticed AFTER getting back to work. here's to incompetence! w00t!
