You know what I love about cable? The <a href="http://www.planetbollywood.com/">Bollywood</a> version of Entertainment Tonight. Clips and interviews to hype all the new hot films from India, breathless audience reviews, and all that jazz! The best part is the <i>music.</i> A clone of <i>The Fast and the Furious?</i> Sure! Throw in ballads! Supernatural thriller with an all-star cast? Clearly, it needs some choreographed dance numbers! Woo! Imagine, say <i>Pitch Black</i>. Now imagine Vin Diesel bursting into a Justin Timberlake style music video in the middle of a tense moment. That's Bollywood. <i>All the time.</i>

Catherine's comment: "Jeff? I'm <i>so</i> glad you're not gay."
