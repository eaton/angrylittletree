I frequent a few web boards, some of them populated by Christians. Sometimes, political topics come up. [Cue groaning.] Recently, a conservative Christian I know posted his opinion that our government's crackdown on freedoms, agressive stance towards other countries, etc., is sad but necessary. Essentially, it was a discussion abuot turning the other cheek, and whether it's practical in the world we live in today. It got me thinking -- I know I'm a bit (?!) of an idealist. But the question he asked -- how SHOULD we respond? -- left me feeling as if I couldn't communicate a simple answer without explaining the entire worldview behind it.

<I><BLOCKQUOTE>well, i have to confess, i am answering with a sort of "right brain/left brain" vibe/thing. my answer was mostly tounge and cheek. yet i did have imbedded in it an element of how i really feel.

granted, we as believers are indeed a part of a wider Kingdom that operates on Gods rules, not mans. So in that snese I totally agree with everything I quoted above frm you about jesus in that sense. war sucks. it would be better if everyone operated by the sermon on the mount...

but then the other side of brain thinks...crap, not everyone plays by christian rules....crazy people will and do wage war on america. as you said, that is the problem. our world does operate by war. the very coming of christs kingdom will indeed be full of bloody war if revelation is literal. its laced into the very fiber of how god has done his thing for quite some time. we are in a new war that our country has never had to face before. a shadow war of cowards who hide in crowds in civilians and count won battles by innocent body counts. there are no forts, no tanks, no fleet of ships to sink, no army in uniform to bomb. in such a cruel test of wills, how in the world can you really expect our goverment to adopt a "jesus" policy that quakers would love, you would favor, and i submit that would allow to ferment and even make easier terrorist players to kill our civillians and soft targets? in other words, how exactly do you make your alternative work in real life instead of the proactive plan we are in now?

Thanks. I hope you know I feel the same and that my posts are not sniping or attempts to make personal attacks. Though we disagree on some things, I think even the Unholy Trinity Of The Cal/Arm Folder (you, BMX, and myself;) have the same underlying desire -- to grow closer to God, understand and know Him better, and become more like Him.

First... I don't know the answer, at least the complete answer. I'm not a politician, I'm not in the military, and I've never had to make the hard choices necessary when defending the lives of those around me. The conclusions I have come to, and the opinions I do have, are based on an idealized view of the world. I ask, 'What kind of people were we made to be? What do I believe God created us to be, in our hearts?' And then I ask myself what kind of decisions I believe that kind of person would make. How they would make them.

Whether or not other people play by the same rules is irrelevant for me. Even though I know that others around me will not behave righteously, I am still called to choose a loving path. This isn't an attempt to say that conflict will always be avoidable. I'm just establishing my belief that while others' choices affect my environment, *I* still choose how my own decisions will be made. *I* still choose the values that I will hold. No one can force me to set aside the qualities that God says He created me for, in order to win a war.

There are two aspects of the question you ask that deserve legitimate answers. The first is the question of what a righteous response to threats would be, theoretically. The second question is implied -- it has to do specifically with the 'new and different' nature of terrorism. I'll try to explain my feelings on them separately, because it's easy to muddle them up.

Theologans and laymen have struggled with the idea of a "Just War" for centuries, perhaps even millennia. While I'm not confident enough to say that no war is justified I think we can agree that it should always be seen as a last resort. A tremendously sobering emergency option when all other alternatives have been exhausted. War is a powerful force, not just physically but psychologically, too. For individuals and for entire cultures, it can bring a blinding sense of intensity and <I>purpose</I> to otherwise normal lives. It can whitewash the internal sickness and decay of a nation's own problems, turning everyone's eyes to The Enemy Out There. It can justify horrible atrocities.

I'd recommend the book <I><A HRF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400034639/qid=1075939670/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-3825322-1486418?v=glance&s=books">War Is A Force That Gives Us Meaning</A></I>, by Chris Hedges, for an in depth exploration of this concept. The son of a pastor, he became a war correspondent in some of the world's most volatile hot spots. His book isn't a hippie love fest or a call for flowers and hugs -- it's a sober look at both the need for force and the corrupting, destructive power of war regardless of what side one is on.

Our culture today gives lip service to the terrible nature of war, but glorifies it in the same breath. How many Americans cheered the idea that Sadaam had been killed in the first night of bombing? I'm not saying that you did, but I know those who laughed, joked, and hi-fived around the water cooler. When my enemy is killed, do I weep for him? It's a question the all of us need to ask.

I suppose that I haven't really answered your question, have I? I don't believe that there is an easy answer to the first part of it. I'm just trying to give you a look at what it is that's in my head.

The second part is also complex, but a bit simpler to address because of its currency. What SHOULD we do about terrorism? The War On Terror? My concerns on this front are many.

First, terrorism is not an ideology, a country, a leader, or a movement. Terrorism is a tactic that's been in play as long as mankind has waged war. Waging a 'war on terror' is as practical as waging a war on artillery, or a war on espionage, or a war on flanking. The moment one man says to himself, "I can't beat that army, but I'll bet I can convince their leaders to leave us alone by scaring the public," the war has been lost, again. And again. And again.

Second, 9/11 was hardly the first instance of terrorism in the US, or the world. It was big. It was visible. But the cumulative effect of life in Jerusalem, or Turkey, or Colombia, or Belfast, or any other region that's been torn by terrorism, is far worse than what we as Americans have had to endure. While the lives lost in the WTC attacks were precious to God, and the day was a genuine tragedy, we must step back and realize that this isn't a new development. It's been going on for a long, long, long time.

Third, as a nation we have failed to seriously acknowledge and repent for the contribution we have made to the status quo of terror. We have, for centuries, supported terrorists when it furthered our political goals. Stay with me here -- I'm not saying that we're simply "Getting our punishment," and should "Take our lumps," so to speak. I'm saying that we have built the house we're living in, along with many other parties. We destroyed villages full of civilians in the Vietnam War and framed our enemies for the atrocities. We funded and trained rebels in Central America to terrorize their countries when the national leaders opposed our political policies. We funded and trained paramilitary groups to attack and destroy civilian manufacturing and industrial targets in Cuba, before it was even a fleeting military threat to our country. We trained the Al Qaida operatives in Afghanistan, funded and supported them when they were fighting our political enemies, but abandoned them loose when the conflict went off our radar. We gave a madman the tools he needed to wage a bloody war on a country we didn't like, then used his posession of those tools as justification for an invasion of his country.

These are facts, plain and simple. They do not mean that we should simple roll over and die now that many of these groups hate US, but they should cause us to step back, and consider what role we have played in the creation of a dangerous, terror-filled world.

To say that terrorists hate freedom and democracy is to hide behind our own imagined purity. That answer shields us from the realization that we face consequences for our own sins as a people. For the decisions made by the leaders we elected.

Is the solution an even harder military crackdown? More war? Is the solution to abandon the principles of freedom and dignity that we claim our country stands for, so that those who hate us will have fewer places to hide? Perhaps. But we seem to be unwilling consider solutions that don't involve precision-guided explosives.

You say that adopting a peaceful, loving attitude will breed more terrorists. In fact, centuries of evidence from many other countries suggests that samll groups of people turn to terrorism when they feel powerless and must strike back with what little they have. War breeds terrism. Does this mean that they are morally justified? No. But pretending "terrorism" is a bitter attempt to steal away 'freedom and democracy' is disingenuous at best. At worst, it's an attempt to manipulate the public into the sort of war-blindness mentioned earlier.

This is more than rambly, I'm afraid. And I'm sure that I haven't come any closer to answering your question. This is the sort of thing best done over a lot of coffee, I think. If you're interested in continuing the discussion, I'm game... but... I fear that I've already rambled past the point of having a point.
