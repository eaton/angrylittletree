<lj-cut text="My Weekend With Robots: Not For Those Who Fear Geekiness">

Saturday night, <a href="http://ineedanewex.livejournal.com">ineedanewex</a> and <a href="http://ddukbokki.livejournal.com">ddukbokki</a> came over for some swanky Mechwarrior action. There's been a lot of controversy in the Mech community about changes WizKids is making to the 'Approved Play' santioned tournaments, but we've never much cared for the sanctioned matches anyhow. It's more fun to haul out huge armies and slug it out for a few hours with some good music and pizza.

<b>The Scenerio:</b>
<blockquote><i>Bum-rush the target and secure the objective. <a href="http://ineedanewex.livejournal.com">ineedanewex</a> and <a href="http://ddukbokki.livejournal.com">ddukbokki</a> control a combined 1500 point force and must defend a shut down Atlas from <a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a>'s 1500 point force. In order to capture the Atlas, <a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a> must cross the length of the battlefield, secure a defended plateau, and maintain base contact with the contested Atlas for one full turn. Only an infantry unit may be used to maintain base contact. <a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a> has twelve turns to secure the objective. In addition, <a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com">predicate</a> may only use two mechs in his attack, while the defenders have the use of four mechs total.</i></blockquote>

In a standard match on a 3x3 foot table, this would've been simple. On our 4x7 foot table of doom, though, with complex terrain, the assault was a little trickier. The plateau mentioned in the scenerio, gave them elevation advantage AND blocked any non-jumpjet units from a direct frontal assault. Although there was a climbable slope up the back face of the plateau, it could form an easy kill-zone for defenders if the assault depended on it. In addition, each player had to stay faction-pure, and we spent the first half an hour vigorously debating the merits of each faction.
