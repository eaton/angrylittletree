Hung out with <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> and <a href="http://tunified.livejournal.com">tunified</a> for a good old fashioned guys' night last night. Oodles of fun, with the shouting and cursing and techno music to accompany an ooooold old classic from our childhoods: <i>RType</i>.

Never was a side-scrolling shooter as nasty, challenging, and addictive as RType. Originally released 17 years ago, it's a thing of sublime beauty. The new Playstation 2 version has just been released, and it's gorgeous. Perfect. Genius. The three of us played it for something like four hours.

After that, we popped over to see <i>Spartan,</i> a new.. what, thriller? Val Kilmer, William H. Macy, and a host of other recognizables star but I had a lot of trouble figuring out what the movie wanted to be. It felt a lot of like "A story in three acts, with each act being a completely different genre with its own pacing." The first third is a tight, fast-paced bit about the team assigned to rescue the President's kidnapped daughter. This portion of the film is, as <a href="http://tunified.livejournal.com">tunified</a> said, "a freight train." It's high-energy, very engaging. Then it slams on the breaks and switches gears: suddenly, it's a political coverup mystery! The transition to this mode is <i>really</i> jarring. As soon as you realize what it is that's going on, though, it's time for act three: <i>Iron Eagle VII!</i> Not quite, but by that  time the film has drifted from taut thriller to mystery to action movie to confusion.

All the pieces are executed perfectly, but it feels like each act should've been its own film. The high-energy kick off is wasted in the 'slow but tense mystery' phaes, and the action movie ending doesn't seem to appeal to the same crowd as the other acts. It's still worth a rental, with some good acting and interesting twists, but I probably wouldn't see it in theaters again.
