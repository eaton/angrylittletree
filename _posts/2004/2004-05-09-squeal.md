This is absolutely the <i>best</i> news of the week. Anyone here remember Suck.com? The original old-school haven or snarkism and cultural analysis from the internet's early days? The site that mae fun of the boom and laughed as it crashed and then got crushed by it? Yeah, that one.

The archives of Heather's classic <i>Filler</i> cartoons is back up and online. <a href="http://www.suck.com/filler/archive/nc_all.html" target="_blank">Click It. Read It. Love It.</a>
