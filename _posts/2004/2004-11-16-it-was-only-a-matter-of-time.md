...Before water-carriers for the Bush administration turned on Powell. Christopher Hitchens, the on-again off-again apologist for neoconservative doctrine, has penned <img src="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2708&print=1" alt="a bitey little eulogy"> for Colin Powell's Secretary of State run.

<i><blockquote>From William Jennings Bryan to Cyrus Vance, history used to suggest a remedy for secretaries of state who became demoralized or disillusioned with the policies pursued by their presidents: resignation. More than just quitting, resignation also at least implies an acceptance of responsibility (as it did, for example, when Lord Carrington resigned as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s foreign secretary over the Falklands imbroglio). But with Powell, one has never been entirely sure whether he considers collective responsibility to be a part of his cabinet rank. Instead, he offers a grudging willingness to stay on, for a little bit at least, if invited—no, make that pressed—to do so. This attitude is normally associated either with insufferable guests, or with people who appear to believe that they are performing the thankless task of holding up the sky.</blockquote></i>

"Powell has always believed in alliances and quiet diplomacy," grouses Hitchens, "except when it comes to dealing with his colleagues in the Bush administration." He explains that Powell, ever the sore loser, played dirty pool in Washington via leaks and snyde remarks to the press. In this narrative, Powell sneakily attempted to subvert the White House's policies and now refuses to fall on his sword with dignity. I'm sure the irony of the accusation is obvious, given the rest of the administration's frequent use of leaks, (combined with selective classification and declassification of documents) to strike back at critics.

As more and more of the behind-the-scenes details of Powel's time at State leak out, it becomes clear that his only failure was insufficient enthusiasm for the flawed agenda Bush's administration brought to the table in the aftermath of 9/11. <img src="http://www.juancole.com/" alt="Scuttlebutt via Juan Cole"> indicates that Powell and Blair were the two who pressed Bush hardest to hit the Taliban in Afghanistan after 9/11, rather than invading Iraq then and there. Similar rumors are already circulating about Powell's opposition to Ahmad Chalabi -- the guy the administration wanted to put in power in Iraq, before we realized he'd lied to us for a decade and sold us to the Iranians. Bremer made a hell of a lot of mistakes in Iraq, but imagining Chalabi in power six months after the invasion is downright chilling.

Even if those whispers of behind-the-scenes Powell victories are nothing more than rumors, though, his better-known disagreements have proven sadly correct. Powell insisted that we should stay out of Iraq or attack with overwhelming force rather than the 100,000 man "lean mean machine" that Rumsfeld sent in. Rumsfeld's dream of a slimmed-down <img src="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.06/battlefield.html" alt="futuristic army">, running fast and light like a high-speed Panzer attack, fell apart when the time came to <i>secure</i> the country. It took a year before the administration admitted that many more men would be needed -- Powell had been right all along.

Powell's greatest sin, it seems, was being <i>right</i> when the policy-makers were wrong. For fighting inside the administration, and serving as a voice of sanity, he's now branded as a narcissist and a back-stabber.

It should be an interesting four years.
