Oof. OK, now I <i>really</i> feel like a truck hit me. After grabbing dinner with a bunch of the Fusion crew, <a href="http://tunified.livejournal.com">tunified</a> suggested playing a quick pickup game of ultimate as a followup to yesterday's. After quite a bit of driving around, we found a proper park and dove in for a good 45 minutes or so of ultimate. I'm happy to say that <i>this</i> time, my team won by a resounding 5-point margin, even though we were playing with a one-man handicap. Rar!

Then, of course, I had to drag my aching, bruised, weary ol' self back home. A long, hot bath and a drink. That's the ticket.

Now, to start getting back into shape...
