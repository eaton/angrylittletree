<lj-cut text="Warning: Here Lies Geekiness of the Miniature Wargames Variety.">

So last night I caved and picked up a couple of <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/" target="_blank">Mechwarrrior: Counterassault</a> boosters. Just to test the waters, y'know?

Mmmmm. Niiiiice.

I now have mortar infantry units. <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?unitid=4733" target="_blank">20" artillery range!</a> <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?unitid=4732" target="_blank">2 clicks antipersonnel!</a> that's right... drop artillery on formations and do *splash damage* in addition to the radius.  The elites are only 20 points, so they're an affordable option for those who can't field thumpers. Also pulled a <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?unitid=4778" target="_blank">'special forces team'</a> and a <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?unitid=4761" target="_blank">scouting cycle</a>, but those didn't hold my attention like the wondrous prospect of transport full of mortar infantry. Although they have the standard artillery lag of one turn, the 20" range makes them super-cheap but effective harassing units.

The sculpts in this set are high quality and, indeed, the mechs have high attack values again. It looks like we're back to a healthy 10 attack as the BASELINE again, after the crop of 8-attack scouting mechs. I pulled two of the new Raider mech -- <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?unitid=4747" target="_blank">a MKI</a> and <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?unitid=4753" target="_blank">a MKII</a>. Both are about 120 points and the MKII offers positive heat effects on its dial, pushing up its brawling damage to two points the moment before it shuts down. Very tricky to play, but its 10 attack and respectable stats mean it will still be useful while it's in the green.

Vehicles are OK so far, looks like there are a number of nice low-point options in the sub-50 range for support. I pulled a <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?unitid=4770" target="_blank">spirit cat assualt vehicle</a> -- 8" range w/two targets, 4 clicks ballistic damage with no special equipment, wide 270 degree arc. For about 50 points, it's a nice supporting vehicle, especially for a crowd of infantry. It's one of the few cheap SC vehicles with solid ballistic values, so I'll cut it slack on the short range. Pulled a <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?unitid=4636" target="_blank">Highlander AA vehicle</a> with a 32" range against choppers. Very nice -- it'll put the fear of God into those Balac choppers again.

Hopefully <a href="http://ineedanewex.livejournal.com">ineedanewex</a> and <a href="http://ddukbokki.livejournal.com">ddukbokki</a> will be able to chill and blow up robots sometime this weekend. The <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?releaseid=27" target="_blank">Liao Incursion</a> and <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?releaseid=34" target="_blank">Counterassault</a> expansions, so far, have been a lot more interesting in the mech department than <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?releaseid=17" target="_blank">Fire For Effect</a> and <a href="http://www.wizkidsgames.com/mwdarkage/figuregallery.asp?releaseid=24" target="_blank">Death From Above</a>.
