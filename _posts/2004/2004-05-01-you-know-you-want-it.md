Even better, it comes from the 1970's comic book adaptation of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0800793013/002-1025168-9907237?v=glance">God's Smuggler</a>,</i> the story of Brother Andrew and his attempts to bring Russian Bibles to the unfriendly side of the Iron Curtain.

 Who knew he was such a ladies' man?
