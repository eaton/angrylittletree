Anyone who tried to send me email yesterday may have noticed that my email server didn't exist. Needless to say, I was distressed by that fact. Eight hours later, my hosting provider started cleaning up the mess -- I've lost email and all mail aliases on all domains hosted on my sites have been nuked. Again, I am <i>displeased.</i>

The total monthly cost for the various web projects and servers that I run is somewhere around $75. I'm looking into adding another site for the graphic novel, which would put it into the $100 range. Here's the trick -- that puts me in the range of low-end colocation services. I'd set up my own server box, drive it downtown to the colocation facility, hook it up, and wallow in their obscene bandwidth. As <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> and I start promoting the comic, we wouldn't have to worry about bandwidth spikes (The low-end account handles 1000GB of transfer per month. I'm not too concerned...). And I'd have complete control over the hosting system, a huge advantage as I'm doing development and other experimentation.

New untold realms of geekiness could follow, here, people. It's scary -- colocation is a compeltely different world. I'm not used to being offered free 5-day cruises to Jamaica if I pre-pay for a year. Discounts? Sure, I'm used to that. Cruises? No. It's like walking into a Lamborghini dealership after a decade of bickering at used car lots.
