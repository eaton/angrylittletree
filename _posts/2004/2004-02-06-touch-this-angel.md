Random thoughts

It's very, very rare that I watch TV. Most of the time, it's either the odd episode of the <i>Simpsons</i>, or a good DVD. Randomly popped the TV on, and an episode of <i>Joan of Arcadia</i> was on. <lj-cut text="Those who don't want to see me analyze it, feel free to skip this entry!">

I decided I'd humor it. The basic premise takes a standard teen girl in high school, family drama, stuff like that, and adds the whole 'God talks to her" twist. 

Now... my first inclination is to call for immediate carpet-bombing of the studio. Maybe, say, sowing the ground with salt. And executing the families of the people who filmed the first episode. As one might guess, I wasn't a big <i>Touched By An Angel</i> fan. I'd rather see a show that's legitimately, honestly espousing the tenets of Budhism on the air than have the sort of sandblasted spiritual pap that's passed off as "Christian" on most network television. It offers no worldview -- no perspective to agree or disagree with, no new insights to consider or grapple with. Just a blase warm-fuzzies faith that reunites long lost sisters and shows grumpy old-timers the joy of giving once a week. I'd rather see a perspective I *disagree* with espoused honestly and competently than see pointless fluff passed off as my beliefs.

Ahem. Where was I?

So, yes. I watched, ready to pounce as I divined the plot. Apparently she's the everage snarky high school kid. Two brothers. Mom who works as an admin assistant at the high school, dad who's a beat officer in the city police department. Joan's big issue is that God appears to her, all crafty-style. Sometimes He shows up as the overweight cashier at the school cafeteria. Sometimes He's a homeless guy outside the 7-11. Sometimes he's the guy working the deli at the grocery store when Joan has to pick up stuff for her mom.

God talks to her. Sometimes He tells her things to do -- "Join the debate time this Monday. Just trust me on this, it's important," and so on. Why? Joan's job is to find out. First, it seems that her job is to help the stuttering guy who she's saddled with as a partner. She researches speech disorders and takes it upon herself to help him -- and salvage her grade in a class that's dependent on <i>speaking skills</i>. Turns out, the last thing the guy needs is a speech therapist -- he's been there, done that. But as she tries to loosen him up, she discovers that he's an excellent writer -- genius, even -- and by encouraging that, she's helped him find "his voice" so to speak.

Mission accomplished!

Or not. Next time God says hello, he gives her a poke in the shoulder and tells her she's not <i>done</i> yet. The guy who stuttered wasn't the point -- it was good, but He told her to join the team because <i>He wanted her to join the team.</i> This causes problems, of course, because she has to argue in favor of a topic she disagrees strongly with, as to most of her friends.

"So?" God asks, while dishing out some deli meat to her. He's the guy behind the meat counter at the grocery store this time. "You believe something, so you can't even look at the other side? You have to discard it?"

"Hey, you'd be out of business if it wasn't for belief," she fires back.

God just looks at her and grins, wearing a hairnet. "No, I Am. It doesn't matter if people believe in me or not, I just exist." He drops a paper-wrapped package on top of the counter. "Now get back in that class tomorrow."

God, in Joan of Arcadia, isn't a benevolent benefactor who sends angels down to do the legwork of 'encouraging tired souls' or something like that. He's an active participant, an observer, the guy who organized a treasure hunt. And not just because He gets off on riddles and puzzles -- He's got an agenda for Joan. He's teaching her stuff, and like any important lessons, the things He's getting at aren't on the surface.

When she tries to 'help people,' it turns out that God is pleased, but she's still missed The Point. When she tries to Convince People, He shrugs and tells her that she's getting closer... But then, when she breaks and comes to a point of acknowledging she doesn't Understand It All, and says what she honestly believes, inconsistencies and contradictions and all, He nods, smiling. She Got It. What was He trying to show her? That the truth isn't about polish or presentation, or even being correct. She hasn't convinced anyone with her sincerity... But she's being true, and honest, and understanding her own imperfection. "You can't have grace until you realize you don't have it all," God explains after the botched debate, wearing a SECURITY jersey and a hoodie.

It'll probably take more than a few episodes to sort out, but I have to admit that I'm curious. It's more than simple doctrinal tidbits -- it's the first an only show that offers not only a smartass heroine and a passably complex family, but a picture of God that so far meshes with how I see Him.

We shall see. We shall see.
