The third. A monday.

Just got home from a night out. Some kind of get-together at the scott's, so I hitched a ride with Mom and Dad to catch a movie with the gang. Listened to Rivulets and Violets on the way and discussed what scenes of a hypothetical movie the songs would go with. (with mom and dad, natch, not the gang. recall that the millenium falcon has no working tape player.)

Went out, had IHOPs, we were all weird and it went as it usually does. After going to Hollywood video and wasting an hour or so there before snagging 'the collossal man' episode of MST3K. there was much loonacy trying to select something. "Blade Runner!" disagreement about the rating. "Sphere!" frenzied screams of revulsion. "Barney!" much laughter.

it's getting really old being around dawn and jason, honestly. sigh. i mean, joined at the hip doesn't even begin to describe it. just sitting at IHOPs we could barely distract him from nuzzling dawn and whispering stuff to her long enoguh to order. at one point, ben reached over and took dawn's purse. beck and i tried to suppress laughter and failed. jason and dawn looked over and blinked. after a little while he stood up and walked away with her purse. then stood on the other side of IHOPs and danced around with her purse. for five minutes. oblivious.

on the other hand the day has gone pretty well work wise. we're getting too many jobs. we went over the project board this morning and looked at each other. "Five and a half man-weeks." then two new jobs and three prospects came in. AFTER that. "Jeff? We've just added forty hours to the board." one of the sites promises to be a challenging job. a furniture dealer who wans a very classy, slick-layout kind of site. it's something that i'd really be excited about tackling actually.

worked a little more on revs to the head lice story, then decided i'd crank on the c9 site -- i found some nice images on photodisc and slapped together a mockup of the main page; david liked it a lot, vocally even. i'm happy with it -- clean and subdued and very classy. the image that i think would be good for a renovation/construction company. it emphasizes clean lines, beautiful workmanship, the that kind of stuff. meshes with the things we want to hit on in the content. and it uses cyberstudio. woo woo!

on lunchour i started working on my ultimate compilation of love songs for purposes as of yet undefined. so far, the mix is:

in your eyes - peter gabriel
kiss me - sixpence none the richer
our restless hearts - mark heard
rivulets and violets - rivulets and violets
flutter + wow - aleixa
kissing tree - sarah masen
she walks in beauty - the black peppercorns
sugar rush - joy electric
over and over - sherri shaw
pluto - plumb
with or without you - u2
captured - painted orange
love songs - fleming and john

i'm trying to figure out how to fit in 'lie to me i like it'...

in other news the concept for my romantic comedy is chugging along nicely. frightening, though, since the main character for all intents and purposes is me. good ol' jeff. or at least the internal fears and annoyances and all that that i know like the back of my hand. which is, i suppose, a good thing. write what you know.

perhaps i'll be able to convince everyone that it's just a fictional character.
