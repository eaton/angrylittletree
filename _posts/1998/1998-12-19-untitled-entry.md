welcome to bloomington.

half a day of work, with a fast blow through the kirkby & associates site, struggling to get the mail server up and running, and the revelation that kara perlot, aka marin, has/had/whatever'd a crush on me for a few weeks. strangeness. bad news from Hydro-flow on the work for the manual -- hopefully it won't become my final kirkby. the projects coming around the curve are really exciting.

and, of course, they mean ACTUAL MONEY.

one o'clock. out the door, into the car, off the crossing, over the road, into the drive, through the packing. nothing but net. arrival at living water: 2:30pm, precisely. admittedly, mom's speedpacking allowed it.

we got off on the road, with the nine of us all crammed into the van and assorted supplies in the trailer. in the front seat, brian: ultimate frisbeeman, guitarist and double-taker. leader of the pack and a very serious dude when it comes to matters spiritual. intense. dating a 29 year old woman who he plans to propose to this new years eve. driver and bloomington local.

riding shotgun, becky: daughter of the owners of the youth center marked as our destination. leader of our small bible study group. bubbly thwapper of cynics. romantic comedy fan currently (apparently) unattached but sought after by...

the man in the back seat. STAN. stanely rocket. the one man defensive line slash mixmaster, aka dj proverb. with a voice as deep as his heart, a force of good in the universe, stan is known and loved by 35% of the population of bolingbrook.

beside him, chris. lanky, loudmouthed and good-natured. the emergency backup drummer called upon to provide the beat. perpetually submerged in headphones and hip-hop; sketching graffiti designs on a spiral notebook wearing an eyepatch to hide a shiner. most often hear: "WOT!? You on CRACK, girl?"

married but alone for the duration, mandy bitner: church secretary and kid-hugger par excellance. posessed with the enthusiasm of ten mortal men.

taking the middle seats, chad and jennifer. the ritzmas. now packing an embryonic bundle of joy, jennifer's mother to the gang function was sorely needed. chad, tom servo in flesh, prvided wry commentary and obscure references as well as geek-flavored insighs. the soundman. the foosman. the man.

next to me, erin the highschool blond. daughter of kentucky parents, fan of max lucado, someone i did not know.

and finally, sprawled in the middle with a driving cap and a book of cons, the diary's skewed protagonist, jce.

the story will emerge.

[random interlude. i know how danny feels, sometimes, about the relationships thing. feeling that the 'friend' slot, no matter how close, is always doomed to immolate once an SO arrves. this is not a component of the story, just a random observation based on other issues going on this weekish.]

the drive, hankfully, was uneventful: random snacking as cookies were passed about, and grooving to cool tunes with an obscene number of discmen. it seems that every male in the car brought along a CD player, though none of us realized the van was sans tape player. Doh! score one for useless tape adapters. chad, however, borrowed my CD player and blissed to U2's War, which he hadn't heard in full for years. it took him back, bay-bee.

"Hey, Jeff!" Stan whispered and gestured me over as we entered bloomington. "I got her Bed of Roses on tape!" He grinned. I grinned. and shortly thereafter, we arrived.


[events to remember: the little imp with the nasty table tennis serve. chad's absolutely frightening foosball skills. chris' journey into the world of hiphop on the second night.
