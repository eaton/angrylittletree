maybe it took longer to make sense. it's the morning at least, so friday and thursday are still rather fresh.

it's curious how working has changed my perceptions -- not just a thing of having money or having jobs to do... but the rhythm of work every day, the sun of the weekends... it changes your body's cycles, and i like it. i mentioned it to alison the other day and she agreed; she likes it as well.

so what's the dael with alison, you ask me. of course, 'you' is really me, since i'm writing this and reading this for myself. but humor the literary construct, please...  we are friends. friends who've admitted attraction for each other but made the decision to stay friends.

i told her that i was afraid because i was attracted to her. worried that it would change the way we got to know each other, like trying to build a building on wet concrete. tried to tell her how i /want/ to connect to her, /want/ to know her, inside out. to see what's behind her eyes, to know her.

tried to convey that massive mind-blowing friendship thing that goes beyond words. sigh. i was chewing my tongue, angsting and wishing that i had words to make it make sense.

"the oddest thing is," she said, "i've never ever thought this about anyone before..but i wonder if i'm not good enough for you. :) not that i'm puitting myself down. but rather, my regard for you is so high...that that is how i feel sometimes."

I swallowed and blinked and stared.

later after i explained my feelings,she said "i don't know if anyone has ever wanted to know me so intimatrely. but in the true pure version of intimacy."

"and that comforts me."

more tomorrow. i flew a kite, i got lost in wheaton, i listened to veggies.
