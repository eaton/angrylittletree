changing, becoming more attentive... but the stuff that he's communicating seems so... DYNAMIC now. it's inspiring. exciting. at the risk of sounding Ronna(tm), Praise God. :)

Finished The Fall of Hyperion, and my brain hurts. the book doesn't have plot twists, it has mobius loops. oy! it's so sweeping. so EPIC. it's the sort of fiction that can make cyberpunk look hopelessly adolescent and self-absorbed.

at church, i ran into the girl joyce introduced me to the other day. still striking; not a big deal but she mentioned to pastor greg that she's a big big fan of mike bickle's. she overheard me explaining the 'mongoose' nick to pastor greg and said, "Wow.. you have such loving friends..." she was joking, I'm sure.

came home. flew a kite. wrote an embryonic poem... about christine.

i see you through the crowd
and memories come rushing back
the sweep of hair, straight and silky-brown
with full lips pursed in thought
i think i meet your eyes
but no words cross this chasm
you turn
and laugh
returning to conversation i cannot hear
i do not understand you
as i once hoped i could
rejection i can palate
indifference, painful in its suddeness
is what i cannot bear
bitterness is past
and pain has long since dulled
but nothing is so sorry
as the words
we once were friends

so i took liberties at the end. but it summed something up, and it was painful-sharp in its clarity. rah rah. we'll see if i like it in a week. over and out!
