"i feel different," alison said. "i'm not the same anymore. i'm ashamed i told you."

we talked for a little while... more than a little while actually. finally she told me that she was glad she told me. was glad i was someone she could trust. she had been afraid, deep-down-subconscious, she said. i'm confused and a little numbed.

"we're not in the same place and that is so frustrating to me becuase it seems so right but its not and i want to and i can't make it," she said after our conversation. as she grew quieter. "and i want to. i want us to be there...  i just still don't comprehend and i just think its not fair that i can see it before me, what i've prayed for, but its not right? its just hard to understand."

she had to leave.

i feel gutted.

i have a story idea rolling around, about a guy who lives a charmed life -- literally. he can't lose. everywhere he goes, he's cursed with good fortune. picks up a lotto ticket and it's an instant win. people find four leaf clovers as he walks by. black cats avoid him. he opens a candy bar and it says he's won a thousand dollars; all he wanted was the candybar. he messes up, and coincidentally someone else takes the blame. without his trying to do anything, even. bad things move /around/ him. but after ten, twelve years of this... he feels the weight of it pressing down on him. "everybody needs to fail sometimes," he says. "no pain, no gain." but he is cursed with an overabundance of luck... and failure is the one thing that eludes him.

it's driven away people he loved; like people jealous of ferris bueller's charmed life, they spat when his back was turned. but now, something big -- a success he didn' want psuhes him over the edge and he starts plotting against fate. he's planning something (?) where he can't possibly win. the ultimate lose-lose-lose situation. and he's going to dive into it and break the curse.

he meets someone on the way, and they fall in love, or something tacky and cliche like that. should he? it's almost like groundhogs day.  meets king midas touch. as he leaves, though, he gets a parking ticket. he used up all his luck finding love.

it's success because then it's in his court. his fate is /his/ to win or lose.

alison told me something terribly personal, something she was ashamed of.

my feelings are so jumbled. of all the times, of ALL the times i wish i could throw myself forward and love her the way she wants to be loved, now is the one. it would be so perfect. but i can't. life is not a movie and i am not an actor. only a confused twenty-one year old boy whose heart is too foolish to understand.

i feel like sobbing but it's not there. i just can't.
