well, if it isn't a long day then i don't know what it is. work went well today; dave was out most of the day and tim and i worked while grooving to mukala, which he loved and dug as well. we harmonized to 'who wrote the book of love' and lisa stared at us suspiciously.

we sucked up to lisa for not mentioning to her that we had bagels, and at lunch i brought in a card and chocolates for tim and i to sign. my motto? always prepared. it went over well and she laughed her head off. "you guys suck up pretty well!"

dave told the story of the pinto he had in high school that he purchased for ten bucks. he got it cheap because it had been lived in by a family of dogs for a year or so, and the interior of the car was all chewed up. like... the handles and the knobs and the upholstery... one door handle was missing so you had to climb in through the door.

when he floored the accelerator it would pause a fwe seconds, then jump to life.

he mentioned someoen defacing it, and tim and i -- in unison -- said, "how can you deface that car?" word for word. lisa, dave, tim and i all cracked up.

tried desperately to work out a weekend get together with alison; strangely enough, this time it was her end the hosed the affair. we were going to meet noonish tomorrow, grab lunch together and then bum around, then watch veggie tales. then head to the prayer chain reunion concert.

it worked out, and then i got a note saying that it wouldn't, out of the blue. her finances, or something like that. i don't know what to say, really. i'm disappointed? obviously. maybe thankful. i'm lonely and tugged towards her, and i don't want the fact that she's /here/ in my face and in person to change me. to cause me to overstep the line in the sand that i drew for her and i drew for me. if i go over one of those lines i want to do it with 'full disclosure.'if hat makes any sense at all.

met up with jason and beck and dawn and danny and deacon tonight at jason's house -- that's right, beck was there. she's here over the weekend and we have all been excited about seeing her. it's odd. perhaps it's just going without seeing her for a while, but every time i notice her she seems older. it's strange -- like seeing a young sister grow into a sarah-masen-esque heartbreaker. she looked classy this evening and i could /see/ deacon wincing. it's kind of funny observing it from the outside.

i showed up, we listened to mukala a bit and jason was blown away. we went out to order pizza and find a movie; i kept snuffles under my jacket and randomly weirded people out by opening my jacket, fence-style, until snuffles popped out nose first. "Hey," I'd say in a pack-a-day voice. "Need a bear?"

i'm tired now; talked to alison about the missing-out-on-hooking up and we had a one upmanship contest abotu who was more disappointed. i want to gather her up in my arms and just hold her for a while. she now has a character on snow now, though... naemd 'fortune.' the monker i bestowed on her. soon i'll have her using generics. i'm fading and my eyes can't stay open.
