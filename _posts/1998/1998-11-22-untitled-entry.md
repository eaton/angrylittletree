total and complete brainfog. picked up fallout 2 after church and tinkered with it briefly. talked to NATE! on the phone and we commiscerated about the whole alison thing, his love life, technology in general, etc.

it's always such a blast talking to nate -- so utterly, frighteningly /competent/. the reason redneck rampage has taken so long is that he had to reverse engineer, disassemble, and port the Build engine from intel assembly code. which is technically not quite legal but somewhat necessary.

he didn't know intel assembly when he started. his next project, which he would have to kill me if he told me about, is the reason he's staying there. "It's quake 2."  metaphrically, of course. oi.

talked to jason online for the first time, which was decidedly strange.
