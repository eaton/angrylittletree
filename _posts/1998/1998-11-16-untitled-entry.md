writing on hydro-flow. grooving to the beatles. other assorted business.

tim turned to me as i put in They Might Be Giants and laughed. "It's been /forever/ since I heard that," he said. "There are so many songs on that that are like... 'man, that MUST have been a dare.'"

it's so strange; working in the office and everything. it feels so... official. i have to -- and I mean I HAVE to -- get the hydro flow trackone documentation done tomorrow. no exceptions. no escaping it. no outs and no way to recover. sigh. must call fred grenning and get more things calrified. write the introduction. write the "working with Trackone" section. finish the tutorial. have lunch with alison!

met a random person on lambda named Marin; i recognized her from snow and a random TMBG reference led to an extended conversation, swap of URLs, and general getting-to-know-experience. very cool.

thought through more trackOne stuff. ung. morple.

it's starting to scare me when i realize that i can't screw around for the rest of my life anymore. I've got to settle into a career. a relationship if i ever get my head on straight. a purpose in life. change the world. things like that... what am i going to DO? i don't know.
