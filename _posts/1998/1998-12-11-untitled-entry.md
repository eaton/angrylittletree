not the best way to start a day... but it'll do.

the past couple have days have been up-and-downish; at the moment i'm lagging hellaciously because dad's copying 67 megs of apps onto my hard drive for backup purposes. needless to say, it puts a bit of a bite in the old 7500's response time. ethernet or no, 67 megs is still 67 megs.
