up and down couple of days. david's been in and out, tim and i have been chugging through work. i'm trying to learn enough about financial junk and CPA services that i can write a marginally clueful web site.

it's thursday night and i'm struggling against a nasty headache; it started creeping its way up my shoulders after a long heated discussion with mom about relationships. i can't even remember the details, but it grew out of today's office gossip: tim's Girl In DC wants to come spend thanksgiving with his family. the trick is, tim's Girl Here in IL will be there, too.

after a bizarre and wacky david-gone-lisa-hanging-out-downstairs day, he brought the question up to us -- sarah's email had just arrived and he was faced with looming carnage. i suggested being open and honest about it. sharing with both girls what the situation was, and being direct about it, out of care for them. Lisa and Tim both stared at me and cracked up laughing simultaneously.
