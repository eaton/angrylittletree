i've impressed myself with my discipline. maintaining the diary for a full month without serious interruption. rah for me! the only difficulty is keeping it interesting; i'm slipping into old patterns of boring re-hash. few things are worse than a self-absorbed poet... one of them is a self-absorbed poet who keeps rewriting the same verse...

work has been going well, and the C9 site is thankfully near death. discussion of the impending iMac purchase has the office abuzz with talk of USB peeripherals and speed issues; the quest for an office still continues. david davoust brought home goodies from the popcorn shop today, and we thrilled to discover that stone jewlers finally took the plunge: we're doing their web site! oh, frabjous day!

I got myself a pizza tonight after work, which was a nice nice treat, and am almost done with endymion. the layout of the ad for nate (the logicware piece) went well, and i snuck the words 'mongeese prefer trackpads' below net's similarly snuck in 'penguins frefer single-button mice' line underneath the address.

i am struck by the fact that christine has become a sort of totem-figure for me. a representative icon of all that is freakin' incomprehensible about the female of the species. after writing that poem (see 'diary of a mongoose, the later entries), i got it /outside/ me. while it feels less destructive it is no more understandable.

why did she respond the way she did? or more accurately why did she not respond at all?

sometimes it seems that the only people who like me -- who are attracted to me -- are people with whom i cannot link on a spiritual level. i'm not sure whether that's a good or a bad thing. good, perhaps, in that i have never found someone whose connection to me was so rich and full that i felt... /swamped/ by the emotion, the way that jason and dawn and others i have watched seem to be.

perhaps that's simply because i keep my emotions in check, or try to at least. but... it is so very, very discouraging sometimes. people like becca... even miri, long long ago... they are good friends, close friends. they have said that they were attracted to me. becca told me, once, that she envied the girl who was my first kiss. i don't know how to respond to those kinds of statements, and to my shame, i wish that other people were saying them.

but that's life i suppose; we don't get everything we want.

beck is moving in about nine days to kansas, permanently. i just found out tonight, and i was startled. when no date was given, it could be pushed out into the nebulous future. now, though... i don't know.

i can only think what beck must be going through...

met a girl from sturgis michigan on the #christian_singles channel the other day -- i blinked and told her that my family had vacationed there for years, and we struck up a conversation. t'was quite fun and we seemed to hit it off, as well as anyone can in a couple hours of chatting in laggy plaintext.

she is a pretty in pink fan -- in fact, her previous nick was 'prettyinpink.' how disneyesque!

i read over these words i've written and wish that they made sense. that they formed some grand unification theory. but they don't, and i'll have to piece together the thoughts some other time. perhaps perspective will give me a chance to see things clearer.
