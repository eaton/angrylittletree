it is late.

i felt the weight of emotion pressing down on my shoulders today, even as i received favorable news from the car dealer regarding the car's price. i arranged the purchase and braced myself for the jitters.

i angsted regarding alison. i angsted regarding my future. and i whipped up a self-destructive textual jag with china*blue, who valiantly attempted to pull me out. finally, her proddings and an email from mom brought me from a flaming plummet to a smouldering slump.

tim's hard drive took a fall, and we spent some time recovering it frantically. and then headed off to pick up My Car(tm).

after innumerable minutes of waiting, the keys were in hand, the financing papers signed, and the toyota mine. i gunned it onto the highway and played Joy Electric all the way home. WOW. my own wheels!

alison was on the phone when i arrived back -- family medical issues, and she wanted us to pray. i did, and talked to her. i'm still... uncertain. treating on glass. i care for her, i feel so close to her... but i'm not ready or sure i want a relationship. and knowing that she does, i don't know what will be a painful jab.

i am still confused but at least i'm confused with wheels.
