attempted to blow through the trackone documentation for a good part of the day, with music driving me on. alison's impending arrival loomed on the clock, but by 2:00 or so, people were starting to mumble about jeff getting stood up... etc etc.

i discovered that i'd been quoted on lambdamoo: "Olive_Guest says, '[Lambda]'s almost like being stuck in an elevator with a large party that's plummeting towards police intervention, as it collides with a group of sociology professors.'" Wheeee! Odd analogies save the day.

Got pleasantly stalked by Marin.

and then alison arrived! we headed for lunch at two thirtyish and walked and talked and... i can't explain the strangeness of it. *sighing* our conversation is becoming less and less... 'revelation.' Fewer of those 'oh my gosh' discoveries about each other. more and more simple conversation and pleasant company and, at least on my part, confusion. sigh.

i don't know. it's funny, i have no problem flirting with people that i don't find myself attracted to in that way, or who i know won't take it seriously. but... sigh.

finally i had to get back to work. and that's what i did, chugging away through trackone until ten or so at night. dave left about the same time, and i panicked when i saw a slip of paper tucked under the windshield wiper for my car... i ran over, gritting my teeth, and pulled it out. "Wow! Cute car! -Alison"

I laughed.

At home I lounged and built some fun stuff on WackyMOO (marin's site). Then called Alison and talked to her as she drifted off. Sleepy whisper-syllables. She discovered that they may not need her in Jersey for that job... which frees her to look at new positions in places like, say... Big Idea Productions...

rediscovered an old poem i'd lost: black light.

i reach across the table, turning up the lamp
you curse me as the flame jumps
and tell me not to move
you're making sketches of her in the dark
wondering how they still turn out
are you an artist or a fool
watching as her skin goes blue
in the hard light of the strobes
she's screaming with her eyes
she's cursing with her smile
and you, you think it's just for you
