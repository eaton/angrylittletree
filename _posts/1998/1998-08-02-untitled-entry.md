So. I got up and went to church and managed to catch Becky's class for the first time. It was interesting and Stan and I were the only guys there. Interesting vibe; there was a lot of giggling between the girls about something that they'd been talking about and we traded exagerated bewildered looks.

After class and the sermon and all that jazz I came home, hung around for a little while, talked to Nate on the phone for quite a while, and then called Lynelle's place to see if I could touch base with her. No luck. Drove out to Barnes N' Noble with mom in hopes of finding something interesting. Found some interesting stuff but I need to get my finances settled down and stabilized before I make any major book aquisitions. Once things are in place I've got a list as long as my arm that I'm going to start chewing through.

Came home empty handed, no video, no book, no nothin'. No return call from Lynelle when I got back, and I probably won't try keeping that going. I'll work out what I can and get together whoever I can for this Bible study that I'm trying to get together.

I don't know -- I'm just sort of in a semi-funk now. Unexplainable, but no less real. I want to create stories that engage people. I want to make characters that they enjoy. That, I realize, is the reason that RP was such a drug. It was instant gratification for the storyteller in me. Sigh.

It's like the thrill of a cyberpunk campfire story.
