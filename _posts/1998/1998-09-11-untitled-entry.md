friday was an average day with average weather and an average workload. polished up some stuff on the howard site, repromoted the brasel site, downloaded the starr report on clinton, and searched for visa, mastercard and american express logos for the c9 order page.

after work (and some confusion about whether or not we were going to be going to the dentist that day) i booked it home and the entire family zoomed trostwards. upon arrival we were quickly put to work, hauling bozes up from the basement. the gang was not yet there -- they had departed to pick up danny and deacon -- but it gave us a little more focused time to get the real work done.

when they arrived, vern explained what was going on and what everyone could do -- somehow the subject of the grue came up and dire warnings were issued: don't go in the attic if it's dark! he explained that it has rubber teeth, and would gum and drool. very unpleasant. we all began carting stuff, though, and slowly the trost home was skeletonized. like a swarm of ants crashing over an animal and leaving the bones or something like that. I can't say that I lived there. Or shared it, much. But seeing the bare concrete walls of that basement stripped naked, the boxes and posters and weight machines torn down, carried away... it was strange. meloncholy.

after we packed everything up the six of us drove to papa johns, ordered a pizza, then ran across the four-lane road to eagle to get dew and corn nuts and some nutter butters. a trip back and we sat in a large circle in the parking lot, eating veggie pizza and pineapple pizza and teh works with garlic sauce dripping. random chatter gave way to thoughtful pauses as i asked everyone what their most vivid memory of beck was.

jason named a song they recorded 15 times over, and had become so sick of they tossed the equipment and went out to play at the park. deacon remembered talking to her at cornerstone -- Dawn remembered talking to her on her bed after she got back from the conference.

i remembered the nifty fifty concert; the one where everyone and their sister knew becky and wandered over to say hello to her. danny remembered sitting and talking to her. we watched a couple cowboy-dressed people wander out of chilis and begin making out on the hill leading to the highway; deacon and i commented on the excellent quality of his leather duster before we gathered up our pizza and wandered away.

it was together. it was a moment; not a sharp, crisp one but a painful one.

must remember: the hug-a-thon at the trosts. strangers being hugged! the trip to walmart. the knight rider marathon. the trip to the trosts, waiting for them for 30 minutes, ranting about the shrike, then reading the morning paper and finally seeing them.

coming home. talking to alison.

scrubbing. more scrubbing; the feel of latex gloves and the anti-damp tackiness of their dusted insides.

more talking to alison. "I don't know what I believe about you." i told her that i don't either.
