thursday. one day closer to the weekend, blessed weekend. it's the 20th of august.

it's really weird -- i'm getting to the point where i'll consider not hanging out with friends just so i can have a quiet night at home. i'm realizing how much of an introvert i really am -- it's how i recharge.

worked on various projects including (woo!) the drug testing lab brochure. I've got a nice front panel for it designed. 'DRUG TESTS' in huge sans serif with a syringe below it. maybe it won't fly but I kind of like it. catchy image. the inside flaps will use a large washed-out pic of a lab-coated guy going over some equipment along the bottom.

over lunch hour i read 'rainbow six' and scarfed two cheese sandwiches. interesting book; terrorist attacks, special ops teams... it's the kind of stuff that clancy consistently does well, so it's fun reading. work dragged on late, though, as a C9 project (the presentation for tomorrow's GONE meeting) jump-started at 3:30. I was there 'til 7:00 scanning in evil evil blueprints and aligning them to make an overhead. it is EVIL.

but, on the upside, there were very yummy munchies present and we had some.

in the news of the odd last night, i found out that Ben up and drove back to kansas, having run out of money. kerblink. it's weird, too, 'cause i was feeling like i was able to really connect with him. i regret not having more time to hang and talk and stuff.

got more email from alison -- she says that she is, and i quote, 'getting bored out of her mind there!' she requests that i find concerts soon here in the chicago area. in other news a long time artful-troller on #christian declared me the reborn messiah.

I! AM! KIBO!
