blowing through kirkby site. occasionally talking to alison and trying to be sane and normal about it. being jealous of nate's yosemite machine. ;-) talking to kristin tonight and finding out she broke up with joe after cornerstone.

got bugged to start up mirrorshades. david stopped in. he started coding. mirrorshades is up again and code is chugging along. blink! blink blink!

Marin pages, "Can I ask you a question, and promise not to take it the wrong way?"
(private to Marin) mongoose nods...?
Marin pages, "You're completely straight, right?"
(private to Marin) mongoose laughs!!!!
(private to Marin) mongoose nods. Yes. Why? :)
(private to Marin) mongoose has been asked numerous times, natch.
Marin pages, "Okay, this must be a symptom of staying up until all hours of the night, but I had a really weird dream last night."
Marin pages, "And probably since you were the last person I conversed with before bed, you were in the dream."
(private to Marin) mongoose nods...?  hmm. okay... :-j
Marin pages, "For some reason, I was in Chicago, and you called my friend's where I was staying and told me that I had to go help you pack your suitcase since you were going on a trip somewhere. (Although I don't remember where). "
Marin pages, "And when I got there, you were very very well dressed, and you sort of looked like my ex boyfriend Chris for some reason. And you were gay. There was no doubt about it. It was sorta funny."
(private to Marin) mongoose hmms. Curious, that :-j
(from Stars) Marin nods. Totally! That was mainly the gist of the dream. It was kinda funny.
(private to Marin) mongoose chuckles. How..... odd. ;)
(private to Marin) mongoose smiles.
Marin pages, "Although now that I think of it, you didn't look like your pictures at all."
(from Stars) Marin ponders, you aren't at all Asian. My ex was half Asian, and looked it. And you resembled him in my dream. I am not sure why. Twisted.
(private to Marin) mongoose hms. what DID I look like? *laugh*
(private to Marin) mongoose considers. Very very odd :)
(from Stars) Marin thinks it's the writing connection, maybe.
(private to Marin) mongoose considers. I still wanna know why I was falmin'. lol. :)
(from Stars) Marin laughs! I don't know! It was funny. Because in my dream, when I first met you, I was like, 'Damn! He's hot!' and then after about 10 minutes, I knew you were gay, and I was like, 'Crap, there goes *that* idea.'
(from Stars) Marin was very amused when she woke up, actually, she was quite entertained that she would have such a dream.
(private to Marin) mongoose just /laughs/.
Marin pages, "Then again, our waiter in the restaurant last night was a real prize, just the type I go for, except that Monique pointed out that the rest of the waiters in the restaurant were gay, and she was getting gay-dar vibes from him."
Marin pages, "That probably explains the gay bit."
(from Stars) Marin chuckles.
(private to Marin) mongoose grins. funny how that all ties together. dreams are /strange/ things. :)
