uneventful. after church talked to brian, the intern dude. he and stan and becky and some other woman are getting together for a movie thing friday; i'm joining them. stan and brian are excited... we can outvote the women now, and nix 'city of angels!' wahooooo...

worked on the mirrorshades compilation. sigh. i just need mukala to do it, that's what. 

i'm losing my poetry, and i hate it. the more i talk online, the less there is /here/. the less beauty and rhythm.
