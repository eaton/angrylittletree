i am petrafied.

that's right. on a run to john's family bookstore to grab some thank you cards for david, tammy, and the rest of those who got me uberspiff presents, i saw (gasp! rhapsody!) this means war on sale for only seven dollars. it was a moral imperative. i am now humming along to the chorus of 'get on your knees and fight like a man.' oh, the memories! oh, the electric keyboards!

the C9 site looks as good as done; we just have to upload it and get more quotes. the hamilton electronics stuff is creeping along at a lethargic and just-barely-acceptable pace... all in all, work seems to be going smoothly. i loaned david davoust 'life after god' and 'hyperion' -- he was aghast when he discovered that i have not read that enduring classic of science fiction, 'dune.' "It's perfect, Jeff! Perfect!"

discussion of various office locations was popular; although the location over the photography place looks like a dead one, with its stairwell and odd-angled walls, there is an office over stone's jewelry thatis occupied but lustworthy. NICE space, big, for onl 500 a month. and RIGHT in the heart of downtown wheaton. when he stopped into the popcorn shop, david davoust mentioned to the (notoriously surly) owner that one of robis' emplyees was lobbying hard for a wheaton location, for popcorn shop proximity. the man turned into mr. rodgers suddenly, all friendly and giving helpful advice about commuting in the town... we both blinked as he retold the story. surliness is just... just... part of the popcorn shop mystique!

when dad and i went to john's bookstore tonight i wandered back from dominicks to listen to more music. the scent of carcinogens and nicotine stung at my nostrils as i passed a girl, camped out on the concrete island between the stores. she hada mountain bike, carried to the center of the grass oasis, padlocked to a tree... and she sat on the concrete facing a building's window, smoking silent and alone. on my way out of john's, almost twenty minutes later, she was still there. i wonderd why, but i didn't have the nerve to strike up a conversation.
