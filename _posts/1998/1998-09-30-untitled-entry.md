well, i've held up for two straight months. let's see if we can make it three, shall we?

is that who i am? a tiny peek into a portion of it? maybe. writing it, i felt as if i was catching the direction. finding the plot again. perhaps my obsession with the little details -- the minute events of my life... perhaps that's how i'm losing the plot. obsessing over camera angles and light levels rather than letting things roll.

are my analogies making any sense? maybe, maybe not.

i'm listening to the new 'mukala' cd, very nice stuff. track 9, 'ice age,' is the key for my new diary naming. it's a mirrorshades song to the max, with hiphoppish tired-smoker-vocals and breakbeat loops in the background. pounding surfy-guitars and electric organs, with samples of police radios zooming past in the background. i approve.

i'm taking bagels in to work tomorrow in hopes of bringing smiles. things have been amazing at work lately, in terms of snacks. today we got cinnamon rolls. how can you possibly beat that?

other random thoughts shudder through my mind; my shoulder's still throbbing but i think it's getting better. or, at the very least, holding steady rather than feeling worse. i had a low-neck headache all day today and it was getting old by the end of the day.

i haven't talked specifically about work for a while. it's been rather amusing really. tim is fitting in well, and he's quite deranged. perhaps moreso than me, in different ways. he's got great design ideas for some of the web sites but is still learning the html to implement them; i'm working on the kirkby & associates site now. man, CPA's can be boring. and not very understanding when you accidentally use an article about head lice as the dummy text for their web page mockup...
