[my prelude. for those who don't know, one of the clients of the company i work for gave us all free tickets to a 'success seminar' at the united center. well... those kinds of things are not my cup of tea most often, as y'all can probably guess. but it was free... it was a field trip... and hey, maya angelou was going to be speaking... so i prepared for the 5:am wakeup time and tossed my journal into my backpack. here's my account of the day: a scary journey into the world of positivism. -- jeff]

wednesday the 23rd. zigday!

5:00 am. alarm clock. dead tired. blink awake and collapse again. dream scenes from aliens4 mixed with bad startrek schlock. wake up at 5:15 and stumble through morning routine.

6:30 am. on the road again! we stopped for mcdonalds en route; i grabbed an oj & hash browns. yum! we're all stuffed into tim's sporty red compact car; "we'll need a can opener to get jeff out," dave warned. last night alison told me to give zig ziglar a big smooch for her. no promises.

we're stuck on the freeway, and the sun is about to rise over chicago's distant cluster of spires and towers. a bed of clouds is hanging over the skyline; pinks and blues, catching and spreading across the sky towards us. dave and tim and i pause to watch it with quiet smiles. now the sun is almost visible - a fiery soft glow that burns out the details of the clouds. the sides of the buildings -- skyscrapers -- they're golden bright off in the distance.

as moments pass the entire sky lightens and the sunrise pales. but the city's skyline still blazes. words cannot describe. i wish i could capture it, find the words to make it perfect and eternal. you must see this!

traffic is slow -- i should've ordered a large drink. dave and tim both won fries and a burger. "jeff! the one they were going to give you was the one with the '68 beetle! an old lady's going to get that cup and throw it away without even looking at it."

traffic isn't slow. it's stopped.

7:12 am. we're going into the city and buildings are multiplying. the thick ceiling of cloud blocks sunlight but fiery gaps still let the sunlight through. fingers of sun reach down from blinding-bright clouds, feeling the road. classical music is playing in the car. beautiful.

just passed the united center after discussing the bulls, parking lots, and monica lewinski. guys in semi-official looking uniforms stand in the street trying to flag people into their respective parking lots.

7:43 am. we're seated and we're startlingly close to the stage. must suck up to advantax (the client that gave us the tickets). they're playing 80's his on the PA system. wooo! woo! now the mighty mighty bosstones are playing. what a delicious soundtrack for the morning.

8:10 am. peter levan or whatever his name is is introducing the seminar. oi. he is enthusiastic to a frightening extreme and gestures like a caricature. it's like watching the hokey pokey in progress! ok, must go. elizabeth dole is coming onto the stage.

[time passes]

well. she has a sort of interesting 'america must get values again so we can all leave our doors unlocked' speech that sounded like a straight-from-the-campaign-trail collection of sound bytes. zig ziglar is coming on. woo woo! (he doesn't look smoochable. sorry alison.) random zig quotes:

"money's not the most important thing in life, but it's reasonably close to oxygen." countered with, "would you sell your future? for a million dollars? two million? three million?" it makes me think of faustian short stories.

"failure is an event, not a person. when you fail, don't ask what you did wrong. ask what you did right. learn THAT from it."

10:27 am.zip ziglar was cool. you were right, alison! although i'm feeling so far removed from my anti-culture angst sensibilities here. there are so many people with suspenders! now there's a singer leading inspiring bouncy beat-oriented pop songs to get us all motivated and cheering. natch.

i found a booth that sells lemonheads!

maya angelou is coming on now. signing off again.

random note: the accountant twins just sat down two rows ahead of me. lathed blond guys in their twenties, with black suits and seriously earnest looks. the sober twins, like the 90's versions of greek money-gods. weird, the intense impressions that i just got from them... no matter.

10:52 am. maya angelou... amazing. positively riveting. now they're trying to start the wave -- what an insult to the poetry.. the dignity, the beauty! but that's the way it goes i suppose. she was the token 'soul' of the day, i think. i miss the rise and fall of her voice already; must listen to 'the art of selling' now.

12:30 we're sitting out on the street outside the united center after an hour with the world's slimiest stereotypical salesman. "the five power-words to make your client say /yes/!" that kind of thing. the clouds from this morning have melted away and the tower is visible over the skyline. i shed my jacket in the sunlight and can feel the crisp breeze through my dress shirt. hundreds of people are out here on the curbs of the united center parking lot. it's like some giant class picnic with beepers and cel phones. smoke is on the wind and someone is playing lounge music on thier miata's stereo. it clashes with the bass-heavy hiphop from the nearby 4x4.

so many people and faces and lives... so many stories. why is that bony redhead laughing into her hand, tilting her head back with wind-tossed hair? why is that young blond adonis glaring at his watch as he sucks a Kool? who is the white-haired matron with a weathered face and a copy of fortune clutched with her knit handbag? i'm going to lay down in the grass and lose my thoughts in the voices around me.

almost 1:00 pm. tim is amazing -- he hits REM in under 10 minutes, apparently. he dozed off on the grass while i just lounged. the conversations bubbling around me are... un-me. talk of the cubs, from two surface-scratching execs. a circle of girlfriends sharing boyfriend dirt. the smell of someone lighting up a smoke. i'm on my back, eyes closed to the heat of the sun, with sticks and weeds pressing lightly. the wind cools my face, and when i open my eyes the sky is crystalline in its beauty. no clouds anywhere, just a domed sea of blue. i should sit up soon.

1:15 pm. the beachboys are playing. everyone is dancing and dozens of beachballs bounce around the united center. they're giving away a trip to disneyland. tim and i dance in our seats and later, when the singer comes out to sing a disco hit, we synchronize on the official stayin' alive move.

1:24 pm. walter payton is speaking. yay, i have orangeheads now!

2:00 pm. peter lowe, the organizer, attempted to inspire us with stretching exercises. after stretching around, he had us imagine stretching farther, visualizing it, then trying it again. it didn't work. maybe i'm immune.

2:24. a tax lawyer is on stage, speed-ranting through "the three financial tornadoes." he tells the story of his family losing three homes to lawsuits and evictions when he was 9. then, with a sudden turn of his voice, a flashbulb shift in his countenance, he spits out the words: "i wrote in my diary that day, 'No one will EVER take a PENNY from me. EVER.'"  he shouts the words, his face growing red. his inspiration for becoming one of the world's most successful attorneys. i do not admire him; i was sorry for his fear.

afternoon break, 2:40. i'm in the lobby thinking now. everyone seems so polished. i don't want polish, i want intensity. i don't want security, i want to change the world. i don't want t be admired, i want to be loved. i wonder, though, how many things i don't do because i am afraid to fail. or because if have tried and failed. there are celphones sprouting from every right ear, and i stand here scratching in my diary. so maybe i still have hope.

3:30 pm. end o break. i rode escalators for fun and found the first aid office. two full-time paramedics! i peeked in and hung out with them for a while.

"oh, yah," the guy said as i asked him if there were many emergencies. "heart attacks. broken fingers. cuts, whatever." his friend nodded assent. "hockey games are really bad. lot of people getting hit by flying pucks. yeah, hockey games are bad."
"any real emergencies when you've been on call?"
"oh, nothing big for me. hockey pucks, fingers..."
"full cardiac arrest?" his friend shrugged. "asthma. people waiting too long to do something about a condition or something."
I chuckled. "don't want to miss the game?"
"oh, yeah." he nodded, flipping the channel on his TV. "people'll do anything to see a big play."

i came back to hear that sammy sosa hit his 65th home run. cubs 7, visitors 0!

3:40 pm. christopher reeves, in a pained throaty voice, spoke. silence from the stadium, complete and total.

"i've learned to avoid nostalgia. none of us can live in the past.  it is so easy to divide your life into befores and afters. but it's not true; there is no before and after. it is simply your life. there is too much for us here today, too much in the future, to do that.

"i was talking to my father on the phone. i love him, but at one point it was as if he was talking to a stranger. i told him, 'dad. stop. let's back up, and connect to each other again.' it kind of shocked him. but i've learned that being as real as possible.. to connect with people truly, is so important. even if we've just met them. that's important. life is too short to wasted on trivialities. that's what i've discovered."

"you can go out and achieve all your personal and financial and business goals. but if you go home and your kids don't want to talk to you and your wife and you live as roomates... if you look into the mirror and you ask yourself, who do i care about and the answer is, me..." he paused and 13,000 people were silent. "then you are not a success."

"to connect. to be able to look into the face of a stranger and feel live... that is fulfillment. to look at a homeless person and say, you and i, we're the same... we are not strangers anymore. that is success. i've discovered that. it is such a tiny world we live in today; it is beautiful because it links us. it ties us together; i can look out at you today and say that we have not met. but we are not strangers."

i am speechless.

"in conclusion... congratulations to mr. sosa." the crowd exploded. laughter, applause, and wonder.

4:30 pm. after a diet/nutrition coach came out, david passed out mini m&ms to all the advantax guys. how in-your-face! now the singer (a blond steven curtis chapman clone) is singing 'i'm proud to be an american.' i feel like i'm trapped in a republican primary! oh my. colin powell is coming out now. must put down pencil. [cue victory march from star wars]

5:00 colin powell is talking about many things. "a country needs a sense of shame." i don't believe him; as he talks about the family, his aunts and uncles and neighbors back in the south bronx... i listened and realized that shame was not what helped him. it was love.

random: "I realized it was over the other day. the home shopping club has debuted in china. it's over. give 2 billion people the home shopping club. communism can't compete with a salad shooter for $9.95."

he talked about the cold war. his life as a soldier and the comfort of a simple world, a map of blue and red. i remembered christopher reeves' words; i remembered his earnest, quiet pained voice. that is transforming, i think. facing the fear of a world with no lines. looking at another man and saying, 'you and i are the same; i do not know you but we are not strangers. we are together here on our world."

"my country's policy was so concise, so focused, it could be summed up in one word: containment. under president Eisenhower, i received my first commission.  'lt. powell, you will take command of these 45 men and proceed to the country of germany. you will locate the city of frankfurt and proceed to the east side of the city, where you will defend this section of the berlin wall from soviet invasion. in the event of a soviet invasion, you will prevent soviet advance into germany.' i saluted, yessir! and followed my orders.

"so clear was our country's policy that decades later, i received my orders under president reagan. 'general powell, you will take command of these 750,000 men and proceed to the country of germany. you will locate the city of frankfurt and proceed to the east side of the city, where you will defend this section of the berlin wall from soviet invasion. in the event of a soviet invasion, you will prevent soviet advance into germany.'"

we paused, suddenly reflecting over the marvel of the orders, their sameness through decades of change.

he told about his time on the joint chiefs of staff, as gorbachev turned the world upside down. he spoke of a time when he and the sec. of state talked to gorbachev; the man was ranting at them -- exploding. the western press had roasted him, and he was livid. "what do i have to do to convince you this is not some great trick?" the soviet asked, veins on his neck bulging. "how much do i have to do? do you not realize that i am putting my life on the line? my career, my country? do you not realize what I am doing? i am /ending it here/. there /is no more cold war/." he stopped then, colin said, gorbachev pulling himself back and noticing the skeptical look on general powell's eyes.

"he looked me in the eye then and said slowly, 'generale, generale... i am sorry. you will have to find a new enemy to fight.'"

"i didn't /want/ that," colin powell said. "it was a great comfort to me. the consistency. the certainty of the world before that time. but the world is changing." he paused dramaticaly. "there are no more red and blue shapes on the map."

i was listening to a president. the man was a master.


5:30 pm. my mind is beginning to gel; tim is drawing funny glasses on all the pictures in the program. the guy talking is all about sales, and i'm half-listening. my popcorn is finished now and my soul is recovering. afterglow from the brush with not-words following christopher reeves and colin powell..

not-words. the indescribable sense of something /beyond/ that cannot be contained in speech. the moment of seeing love in someone's eyes. of seeing sunrise tear over the horizon through the clouds. of taking the bony weight of a sick friend in your arms, giving life when they have too little. it is the moment of glancing at the night sky, seeing shooting stars stitch the dark to light. it is opening a letter from your grandmother that you had lost, the smell of her clothes still clinging to the paper.

the not-words is what you can only wrap, never contain. only cast shadows of, never see fully. it is the swelling of the heart and the crashing, too. it is the fabric of life. it is a kiss from the Creator of time.

5:47 pm. "you want people who subscribe to martha stewart's magazine? entertain guests, have credit cards, live in high-income neighborhoods, and have allergies? no problem. it's there. privacy in america is dead." a targeted-marketing expert speaks. further proof of my rule: big brother doesn't want to run your life. big brother just wants to sell you new windows and siding.

6:42 pm. the conference is over -- united center is empty. dozens of workers with plastic trash bags and brooms emerged from side doors, nooks, crannies, everywhere. combing the floor, rows of chairs, everything, like a machine. or ants. sweeping litter away in a wave. it reminded me of a twilight zone episode about a man who wakes up early, to find a construction crew outside -- building the world. it's the people who make the future and tear down the past. that reminded dave of the langoleers and an explanation of that movie followed.

on the way back to the car, four girls -- six to ten maybe, holding bags of groceries -- they asked for bus fare, pestering the group at the crosswalk before the light changed. "fifty cents! fifty cents!" one girl screeched over her friends' less specific entreaties. "lady put us off the bus 'cause we don't got fare, we gotta get home!" we all did the fudge-and-fidget, but i dug out all the change i had in a handful and offered it -- enough for one of them, at least. the lady nest to us pulled out a nervous dollar. as we walked away, dave and tim and i wondered if i'd been conned. "so i'll skip lemonheads for a week, god forbid." dave nodded. count the cost, i guess.

As we got into the car, the guy from the lot followed us asking for a tip for watching the car. he kept talking after tim and dave declined, following to ask through the rolled-up window and curse when we didn't tip. "so.. not letting people steal the car is extra now?"

8:15 pm. we stopped for dinner at a gorgeous place in oak park. the cafe winberie. amber-white tile floors and rough brick walls with art deco posters from the french '40s. warm brandy-colored lighting and subdued yet snazzy music. i want to remember the place -- bottle it forever. we spent almost an hour brainstorming intensely. finally, we left full and contented.

tim and i teased and taunted the leggy raven-haired lass manning the front desk. "no one gave /us/ crayons to color with while we were eating. you've got them right there, but were we offered? noooo..." we put on looks of mock insult and she apologized in good humor. "nope, too late, i've been robbed of my childhood," i replied with a sad sigh. she laughed and we left, tim and i in shades at night. we make a good pair. david sighed.

on the way back to my place he popped a massivivid cd into the car's sound system and we blasted with the windows open all the way.industrial-techno. i like tim.

it was a good day.
