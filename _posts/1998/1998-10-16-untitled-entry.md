off-balance. tim turned to me at work as i uploaded javascript-flavored web pages and listened to the common children. he told me, in a fit of unsolicited confession, that he would be flying to DC this weekend to see his brother. sarah, his east coast girl, would be there. "She's a friend, but she thinks there's... well, she's up /here/," he said, gesturing above his head, "And I'm down /here/." Around his chest. The implication was obvious: her expecations here a good deal higher on the plato scale.

she wrote him letters every day in germany. i didn't tell him that he sent her flowers from chicago and talked to her every day on the phone. to me, that implies /something/. i just nodded, though, and he sighed. "So, I've got to tell her I'm dating Brooke."

I winced. local girl wins out every time.

ross from c9 construction got another 30K bid op from the site! sun microsystems. we laughed about it and reflected on how /encouraging/ that site is. it's so polished and nifty! my baby.

then after lunch tim got a call, and his voice dropped. consoling words could be heard -- "No, no, it's okay you called, how are you doing?" "When did it happen?" and "Were you close to him?"

sarah's grandfather died unexpectedly today, shocking her family. tim's face went bloodless for a moment, and after fifteen minutes or so he hung up without comment and turned back to the hulkren funeral homes web site. he didn't make any jokes about caskets today.

i thought about what i would do if i got that call from alison and it hurt. i would want to hold her in my arms like i would any other friend, but that act is so complicated now. i would want to touch her but she is far away.

must remember about the evening and the strangeness at jason's. planning for alison. et al.

[after the fact addition] after work, alison came onlline and told me that -- gasp! -- she would be in kankakee and wanted to know if a visit would work out. "Let me guess -- you have plans?" i didn't, though, and an attempt was made to work something out. but she had to depart with the promise to call me.

fast forward two hours. i'm huddled in the hallway of jason's house, 50' of copper cabling snaking into his parents' bedroom,  mel cracked open, and me jousting with my PC card modem in Zterm to connect and talk to her online to work out the details. jen the house sitter and her friend are watching 'the object of my affection' while i curse at Hayes. i convinced jen (the house sitter) to break me into the scotts' AOL account, then telnetted into wwa.com and pine'd my way to a letter for alison. played email tag to no avail.

finally, it was a wash and dad picked me up -- but i did get to see beck; which was Good(tm). as we left, the gang was at the park and i had beaten them to the house. so i left a note, on two feet of napkin. 'i have stolen your cool, you may never see it again. -- an anonymous furry abductor. see you later, kids.'

when we drove off, i told dad to turn into the park. the car careened to a stop i nthe parking lot and i saw two figures sitting together on the bench on the playground. the lights hit them, head-on, like searchlights. i figured it was jason and dawn, and grinned. "Dad, shift to neutral." he did. "Rev the engine. No, faster. Yeah, like you're getting ready to burn rubber straight at them." He did, and I laughed. As they stood up and walked towards the car, dad started to turn around and the car's lights -- on bright -- tracked them like a bad episode of COPS. finally we drove off, passing them slowly on the sidewalk. Perfect and theatrical.

the cool moment of the night, though, was at jason's house. upon arrival, jen and her friend were there and locked out of the house. waiting for jason and beck and company to arrive and unlock the door. i waited with them on the stoop for a while, then paced, then wandered randomly around the back of the house, which they had already searched for open doors. We'd been waiting almost 30 minutes, see, and it was getting cold... I sereptitiously checked the doors in the dark, feeling quite sneaky. one, locked. navigated aroudn patio furniture silently and tried again. two, locked. another sneak around a patio table, feeling around... three. i gave a firm tug, and the glass door slid open smoothly. i let myself in, closed it, and unlocked the front door. flung it open with a flourish, and grinned. they turned around suddenly and stared. "What? How did you get in?" "I let myself in." I grinned.

i got home, though, and immediately connected. as i guessed, alison was there -- unamused by my unexpected disappearing act. "you could have told me that you would be leaving, and we could've tried to work something out before i had to go," she said. I apologized, and she accepted... but the conversation felt a bit stiff. awkward. "Do you really want this?" she asked. "Or am I pressing you into something you would rather not do? I want to know that."

we made our plans, and i collapsed to sleep.
