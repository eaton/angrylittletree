well. i'm emailing this to myself because i'm too lazy to mount the captain
crunch partition again. so sue me!

good day all in all, although watching deep impact after church left me
feeling like i was hit by a train. holding back tears, the works... sigh.
i'm so much more confused than the lasttime i watched it. conveniently, that
was recorded in my diary as well. i'm talking to alison as i write this,
and... I don't know. i feel like i'm getting closer to her. but in the way
my head wants, too. i'm glad.

when the burden of romance is gone, honesty can happen. it's like... when
someone meets someoen and wants to put on their best face... wants to
believe that the person they have fallen for is everything they've wanted...
the questions are different and the answers are too. there are fewer
assumptions amde and a little more exploring.. and that, I guess, is what
makes it beautiful.

did more driving aroudn today and enjoyed it. sigh. i really, really love
having my own car. :-j

i'll pass out now, and probably summarize my alisonconvo later. it was...
interesting. i feel like... i can't explain it. it seemed... more her than
before. i'll think about it. g'night.
