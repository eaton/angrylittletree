i hurt. brian's game of ultimate frisbee didn't pan out -- only stan and he and i showed at threeish -- but i still got more all around exercise than i'm used to. an hour and some of running, jumping, lunging, grabbing, throwing, tripping, and every other stretch imaginable. i'm so proud -- i learned that it's bad to catch the frisbee with your nose!

after getting all sweaty and grassy and generally winded, we hiked to 7-11 for slurpies. "A slurpie isn't food, is it?" Brian argued, since he's fasting at the moment. "I mean.. It's ice... and it's..."

"Chemicals," I offered helpfully.

"Yeah! Exactly!"

Stan agreed, and the decision was made. We hung out on the park's playground and talked music and ripped on Bed of Roses and generally just hung out.

The sunday school degenerated into random socialization and exalting of christian slater on the part of the girls. cries of, 'stalker! psycho!' echoed throughout the room when the movie was mentioned, and becky's sister was there. how disorienting -- they're twins! and they both like bed of roses. gah. double-team!

friendly barbs were exchanged, but neither side gave ground. stan just shook his head sadly and mumbled something about any guy lookin in /his/ window at night gettin' something thrown at him...

all in all, a funky day. my discovery: ride of the valkyries is FUN in the car.
