"YOU'RE goin to kansas, too? what are you people, a bunch of freakin' mormons?"

[*******] Stephanie: You know, Jeff, if you don't ever date someone, odds are that you won't ever find the right person, and thus, won't ever fall in love.
[*******] Grady: bite me.

"See, Deacon and Becky are two people who have special feelings for each other. Dawn and Jason are one person that loves itself..."

i'll have to transcribe in my diary/journal entries another time... but the concert ewnt very very well. deacon purchased a copy of the limited edition prayer chain cd, and bought one for beck as well. most of the evening involved beck attempting to sneak him the money for it while he creatively dodged her attempts. danny and i wandered the area, an excellent place for hanging out and such, while the various bands played. discussed relationships and assasination attempts and snackfoods.

stopped at wendys before we arrived home and chatted in line with a boisterous gang of college girls getting back from 'farm aid.' the prayer chain rocked, and i managed to get the signature for alison. muaha.

a pervasive shroud of bummed-ness hung over me at times; missing alison.

saturday morning i went out and test drove a corolla DX; it's a very nice machine and the salesman was chomping at the bit to sell it. it reeked of primer; body work alert!
