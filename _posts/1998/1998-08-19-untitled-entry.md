went out to get greeting cards or thank you notes or whatever-the-heck i'm supposed to give to people when they do something nice for me. i snagged cards with ducks on them, for the obvious squeaky tie-in. mom sniped at them because they were effenimate. it took an act of will not to just tell her to bite me.

but. enough of that. i read though the usenet kooks faq and sighed with nostalgia. steamboatcaptainman... xav... the OLD days before i was around and before even nate was around, and i thought that the A-team was pretty K3WL!!!... I was thinking about it, thinking about my old posts to RMC and all that... i want to help nate with his remake-usenet-as-god-would-have-it plan.

c9 construction is coming along nicely and I am now working on a brochure for 'comprehensive toxicology services,' a company that does drug testing for 'correctional associations.'

purchased a quantity of bouncing happy face balls, which I will now stuff into  my backpack for Later Evil Use(tm), and have been contemplating a return to RP. When I think seriously about it rather than playing with the idea it quickly becomes unsavory and I dismiss it. But when I take a step away and talk to myself about other htings, it starts feeling more attractive. like some sort of memetic game of 'red light/green light.' the idea is icky when i stare at it, but it sneaks up while it's in my peripheral vision.

must remember the boat that tammy drove while she was here -- it ate a cab for breakfast, that suburban.
