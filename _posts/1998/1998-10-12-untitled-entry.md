yeuch. kind of a blah day! the computers seemed particularly crash prone today, and i spent a fruitless half an hour or so just trying to open a document in pagemaker.

then trying to drag windows.

and finally, trying to /boot/. tim's machine soon suffered the same fate, and while i poked and prodded with extensions manager and techtool, he broke out norton and company. a good portion of the day was lost to such things, much to our chagrin!

i tried fruitlessly to hack the pfs site to work with under america online 3.0 -- with its wonky javascript support, that's like trying to glue an eel to the wall. difficult on multiple levels, and arguably pointless... but hey! the client is always right :-)

after work, ate and jammed to fcb for cheap cds -- columbus day specials, yay! talked to trage-- ermf. alison, and discovered that she will be in chitown on the 21st to sit on on a big idea productions day. COOL!

must... sleep.
