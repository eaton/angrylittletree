alison returned. left a message on her machine at home and then called every 20 minutes for 3 hours until she arrived home. caught her jsut before she was about to jump online. yay yay! we talked and laughed and smiled -- at least i smiled. in the background her brother said something about praying for fog so he wouldn't have to go somewhere. "Jeremy, don't do that, you're abusing prayer!" she said.

her trip to dc was good except for harrowing experiences on the subway. a psycho staring at her and mumbling under his breath about bashing her face in for a long while, until finally she got onto the train... after that little joy, she went museum hopping and got lost in downtown DC. other hijinks, including a getting-lost job through a run down park in the projects, rounded out the afternoon.

we talked and smiled and enjoyed each other -- or at least, i enjoyed the sound of her voice.

tried to work out the details of getting together on the weekend -- potentially -- and began entertaining the idea of her staying saturday night and going to church with us sunday.

deep talk ensued.

thursday was weird, and dark clouds gathered regarding the robis finances -- overheard discussions with bill collectors, and a strangely timed exit from the room on david's part. coincidentally, he'd just picked up the phone to answer a call from the payroll agency that writes the paychecks for tim and i.

a little unsettling. although, david's abduction at a meeting by a Y2K prophet/naysayer led to our brainstorming the ultimate newyear blockbuster. "Y. 2. K." in big letters. with explosions! it's got the makings of the perfect action flick. programmers in bunkers, coding madly as a giant digital clock counts down the hours... exploding oil pipelines, rioting, mayhem, and the triumph of the human spirit when a small community bands together to help each other. we scared each other with the idea, and decided that if we knew a produce we'd try to actually pull it off. snirk snirk.

came home and departed for jason's with the monetary stuff weighing over my head and helped him film the Thing For Dawn. he played a court jester and she played the princeess -- he slayed the dragon and they were married at the end. i turned to danny and asked, "Does the subtext of this production unnerve you as much as it does me?" he just gave me A Look(tm).

talked to alison. a discussion about laughter ensued and i mentioned hers. "I know, I know, I have a loud laugh," she said, with an unarticulated whiff of self-consciousness that might have been my imagination. "But I like it," i replied, and she was silent. "I suppose that's what matters:)" she said, and I smiled lopsidedly.
