other random details from last night's show: tried on the studded leather collar beckie has lying aroudn and danny declared it 'not jeff.' "Jeff. take that off right now. you look like you should be in a gay porn." i sulked.

uncomfortableness earlier, as rachel wandered in. it was like watching magnets with legs -- there was always a certain amount of distance between rachel and beck, as they orbited each other around the club.

called the bixler home today, thinking that i would get the number of the place where she's staying and suprise alison with a call. talked to her dad, which i was somewhat nervous about, but it seemed to go well. "Ooooh... Yes, she's mentioned you. She talks about you an awful lot..." I grinned as her father spoke slow soft words in an indiana accent. "She really enjoys you, you're a good friend to her." I wasn't sure what to say, and I can't remember what words i tossed out.

after further calling, and a conversation with mrs. bixler, i managed to get A Number to call. tricky, since there were no phones where she was staying...

i left a message at the conference center switchboard: "For Alison Bixler? OK, it should say, 'boo.' From Jeff. Yes, 'boo,' like a suprise. Thanks!"

i got a call an hour later; alison was confused, laughing, and -- i think -- delighted. i hope, at least."how did you FIND me?" I couldn't keep the grin down. on the other end i could hear her bright laughing and the voices of other people around the pay phone. "So... what did you call for?" "Oh, just to say hi." and she started laughing again.

after she told how things were going and i explained how i'd done it, she had to go. "You're awesome, Jeff," she said, voice quieting. I paused, flustered, and made some witty comment. "YOu almost said thank you," she replied with a smile in her voice. "Almost. You're getting better."

I told her I'd catch up with her later. "Promise?" "Promise."

i didn't stop grinning til i went to sleep.
