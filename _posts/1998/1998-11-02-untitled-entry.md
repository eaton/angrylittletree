well, turkey day approaches and the robis gang may be moving into the office by next week. unfortunately it needs to be painted promptly, which means fumes el grande. hopefully the weather will be good and we'll be able to throw the windows open. sigh!

in happier news, i'm beginning to grok the underlying concepts behind trackone, the access database from heck. fire hydrant flow control software -- the undiscovered niche. i'm still disappointed that i can't make hydrants start gushing with the click of a button, but it's a happy thing to see the docs for it start looking like a do-able project rather than a frustrating exercise in "tell the user what this button does."

run on sentences, wheeeee-ha.

talked to alison briefly over lunch. she misses me she says... i'm confused. in one way, i feel as if... as if i would be attracted to someone who didn't /need/ me. alison doesn't, not in some clingy sense. but... i can't explain it. perhaps i'm just afraid of holding someone's heart -- easier to care for an aloof person, because there's no chance of hurting /them/.

i want to make music, and towards that end am collecting samples. must actually experiment with beat loops and rhythms. sigh. why are there no good web sites on music theory?

my mailing list is really taking off. after connecting sunday night, i discovered quite a few messages on the topics i'd tossed out, with thoughtful, eloquent discussion on all parts. it was so encouraigng to see that an idea i had actually got people talking about something of consequence! i fired off another note about the nature of identity, and idsassociation on the net, spawned as i thought of the conversation alison and i had over IHOPs on sunday afternoon.

was subsequently teased by china*blue, who said that even the slimmest morsels of alison updates left her feeling warm and fuzzy and maternal. "you're just so... amazingly, inescapably sweet. it's like i'm seeing the pre-romance love affair of the century in progress..."

i don't know how i feel about it. i'm conflicted. i'm praying. the works.

the beautiful gorgeous car was sold 6 hours after i looked at it, natch.

the office may well have DSL, rather than webramp and a gaggle of modems. awwwwww, yeeeeeah! it's up to me to figure out how to implement it, unfortunately. at least we'd be using an NT box -- I'd be able to get network administration experience while doing it. 

am exhausted and ever so confused about alison.
