more long day, more strange day.

worked worked. trying to trudge through trackone, buy am experiencing total brainlock in critical areas. I got on the phone with fred grenning and talked to him about some of the stuff, clarifying, and now it makes sense more.

in the strange news of the day, marin's moofriend asked me out on a date. wanted to know if i was interested in going out for coffee or dinner or something like that. how truly, truly bizarre! i said something about not meeting people IRL before knowing them for a while, and she was cool about it.

friday is speeding towards us like there's no tomorrow, and there is no way i'm going to finish this project and kirkby. welcome to hell.
