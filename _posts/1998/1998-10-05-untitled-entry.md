i'm really starting to get bummed -- perhaps it's just the lack of sleep i've been suffering under after the concert and all, perhaps it's something more. but i try to write and it's just not there. i have so many /ideas/. i lack the discipline, or the energy, or even worse, the hope to keep plugging away. what will i ever accomplish? i don't know.

i'm flirting with the idea of going celibate for a while. not writing anything, separating myself from creative words, and seeing how it affects me. like i said to cecil murphy at the writer's conference... maybe i'll just explode, eh?

i'm beginning to remember why i left phoenix. after trying to juggle a few TP ideas, things just aren't moving. Sad but true; the Hope Station player base is an incestuous lot. There are a handful of active players, and the universe is just a little too tight to give them improvising room on large things.

It's the problem with creating space opera and only letting people play gaffer parts.

i'm rambling now, and i'm being pointless.
