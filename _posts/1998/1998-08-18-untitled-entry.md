never, ever mistake the coffee mug for the syrup pitcher at IHOPs. seriously.

actually it didn't happen to me, but the possibility was there.

went out for lunch with david davoust, and after much driving around we realized that the bavarian inn was the only place that was open. no great loss -- we both like it, and i know the menu well enoguh to explore around a bit. i got 'grandma's roast' and some mozerella sticks. we appraised them and i explained to him the details of how one weighs a mozerella stick's merit. cheesiness ("One you're in, it's all just cheese... the consistency is the really important part.") as well as breading ("Crunchy. Definitely crunchy, but not too thick. You don't want the stick all limp and soggy, but it shouldn't feel like you're biting a shell.")

when they arrived we segued into a the technicalities -- should the sauce be considered an inherent part of the experience, or a side issue weighed on its own merit? I posited that the sauce is a secondary affair. an add-on if you will. the stick should be tried sauceless first, then the sauce-and-stick combo given its own judgement. sometimes excellent sauce can hide a crummy stick, and vice versa. it's a shame to mix the two up.

he presented me with my birthday gift -- a copy of Asimov's Foundation, and a B&N gift certificate. I was certainly not expecting it, but I was very thankful. MORE SCIFI! now i just need a road trip to justify reading it all...

while eating i talked to david, discovered he's been an RPer (!!!) and mentioned my ideas for using the medium as a communications tool. He was all with it, clicked immediately and it was a blast. we traded RP stories, from storming and conquering castles to Rob (nuff said).

after work went out with Tammy, or at least planned to -- in reality we hung aroudn at the house and talked for around two hours, after she presented me with my gifts: a Chris Rice cd, two Pooh ties, and a copy of Say Anything. woooah! she explained about the new house they were moving into ,stuff like that... and finally at 9:30 we did a quick bop over to IHOPs for belgian waffles and sausage... the perfect late night snack.
