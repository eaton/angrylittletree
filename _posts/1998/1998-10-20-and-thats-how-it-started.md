the ride to mcdonalds was silent, save mumbled comments from a sullen jason. danny shot me nervous looks and i sat rock-jawed in the back seat, considering courses of action. as he pulled into the mcdonalds parking lot, i opened the door and walked around the back of the car.

pulled open the drivers side door and grabbed a startled jason by the collar. pulled him out of the car and shoved him back against the passenger door as danny gaped. jason blinked in shock as i pinned his arms and got in his face

"you're scaring the shit out of me, jason. get ahold of yourself before you screw up your life and you screw up dawn's life."

a beat.

"What?" He just stared, confused but plummetting towards pissed.
"She looks to you to fill her everything, man. You can't do that, nobody can."
"What do you know? You don't know what you're talking about." He laughed incredulously, shaking me off as i backed up. "You don't know what she's thinking."
"Any idiot can see it, Jason."
"Okay, what do you see then?"
Danny broke in, against his better judgement, and offered a comment. "You're not two people who like each other, jason. you're one person who loves itself."
"You're Jawn."
"Yeah? So?" Jason stared at both of us then, like a mutinied captain or a cornered prisoner or something. "I know we are."
"It's not a /healthy/ thing, man."
"Who says? It's what people are /made/ to want," he shot back, in my face now, starting to walk around me to the mocdonalds. "Or don't you believe that?" he shoved a couple bucks at Danny and blew past us. "/You/ wouldn't understand," he muttered. "i'm hungry, let's eat."

danny just stared at me like i'd flipped out, and i shrugged, stone-faced. followed jason into the mcdonalds and wondered what i'd done.

it all started when i got together with jason and the gang right after work, hitching a ride with dad as he went to a church prayer meeting. strode up the drive and elisa startled and waved. "Jeff! i love your hat!" i nodded, smiled, and as she related to leah the trials of the unruly children she nannies, i turned and commented, 'that's what valium is for.'

jason and beck were still out picking up danny so i played with jazzy for a while and talked to mrs. scott a bit. tossed the squeaky rubber hamburger and watched the pooch jump for it, toussle with it, and growl as she wrestled it around. fierce things, those squeak toys.

jason's idea of the evening was for danny and i to get together and help him plan out the details of the party-play for dawn this weekend. it being her birthday and jason being broke, jason's been planning a silly production starring her as the main character. problem is, he's been trying to plan it for ages and hasn't made progress. so tonight, i was supposed to meet him over there for a planning session with danny to figure out the details.

but dawn showed up as we were about to depart, and jason became a noodle. she pouted because she couldn't come along, and he couldn't tell her /why/. as he told danny and i when we pulled him aside, "I feel so /bad/ just telling her she can't come! I don't want to hurt her..." we sighed. "she was hurt and a little mad yesterday when i didn't spend time with her for it," he said, looking stricken.

"Pathetic, man. Pathetic." he wandered out to tell her, and five minutes later we walked out to see what was up. he was lying fetal on the carpet. "Make up an excuse! I clinched!" he mumbled, muffled. "My dog ate my homework," i muttered, turning on my heel. in another room, joyce laughed. it would've been funny if it hadn't been real. danny pulled him away, then smacked him and told him to snap out of it.

forty-five minutes later, jason was outside, trying to 'explain to dawn why she couldn't come, gently...' danny and i sat inside, pacing and commenting on the pathetic vision of masculinity that had stood before us. we headed outside, prodded by joyce, and grabbed jason by the arms, dragging him up the driveway towards the car. he wrestled loose while dawn stared daggers at us, then scampered back to sit at her feet and talk. we sighed and conceded defeat, walking back inside.

mrs scott heated up some dinner for us, so danny and i ate mashed potatos and applesauce and roast. "he's out there blaming us," danny predicted as he munched bbq chicken. "i'll kill him with this fork if dawn hates us because he blamed us." i nodded and we made plans. then jason blew in after forty-five minutes out there, looking like he'd just been in a fight. stared at us and muttered, "oh. you ate. thanks." and trudged downstairs without another word.

"Want a popsicle?" I asked, waving my after-dinner dessert. danny just sat, silent and neutral as jason shook his head. "no. you want to go out anyways?" even though it was late. and past the time we'd planned on getting back. "sure," i said, hopping up to follow.

on the drive he angrily explained the 'way things are.' "she's going to be at home now, all alone and with nothing to do," he said, pained.

"it's an hour, jason. an HOUR. pull yourself away from the girl for a freakin' HOUR to plan her BIRTHDAY PARTY."

"you don't understand!"

and that's how it started.

it would be so easy to fall backwards ino the welcoming splash of alison's affection. but i can't. i see jason and i can't bring myself to. i remember what i think and believe and know and feel. i've got to be me. jeff. the ice-man that people gape at when he mentions he likes someone, because they thought he was asexual. i've got to lock it up and throw awy the key. i'm too tired to think. goodnight.
