week and some since my last 'real' diary entry -- I can't say that I'm thrilled about that. maybe I need these dry times so I can return, attack the blank page with renewed vigor.

after church I swung by the harps for dinner; yummy yummy! talked to them for quite a while about their history, how they got here, things like that... how they met. it was sweet; romantic. got me depressed as hell.

i'm like that lately: mom ripped into me the other day and said a bunch of stuff about how she knows i'm off looking for a 'relationship' but i need to work on myself before i go looking for the person who's perfect for me. i felt like laughing in her face. the problem isn't that i'm off looking for someone, it's that i'm royally pissed at God that i feel like he's not let me feel free to do that. or perhaps i'm angry at myself; for not jumping in.

talked to marin at length about it after making candy cane reindeer with mom and dad. ("Valley of the Mutant Reindeer! Look, he's only got one eye!" "Jeff! Put that other eye on!" "Nah, I'll put three on the next one...") spammy connected conversation, interlaced with one to david about the nature of biohacking and AI tech in mirrorshades.

i sent email a few weeks ago to alex of anthology.net fame; i got a response back the other day! i feel so noticed.

how hopelessly pathetic. i do think i'll point her to heyoka.com though; her comments about readers attempting to impose self-consciousness onto the text of anthology is reminiscent of heyoka's comments about the scatter project.
