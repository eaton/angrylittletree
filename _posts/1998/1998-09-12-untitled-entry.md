a sleepy, uneventful day to say the least. as i type this a row of yellow smiley face superballs are lined up on my keyboard watching me. woke up late, went to church, took mary along with us and she loved it. i had trouble staying conscious.

came home. zoned out -- talked to china*blue briefly and zoned more. hammered out a letter to the girl from wheaton who sent me email via the christian connection; hopefully i didn't sound too wiped. went to the store with the fam and was shocked to learn that dominicks does NOT carry corn nuts! it's a travesty.

nate forwarded my the coolest home page ever created -- jules.com.

tried to work a little on my web page, a little on the story, etc etc. couldn't focus for lack of sleep and realized it would be better to just go to bed and crash. now, to get the energy to push myself up off the chair...
