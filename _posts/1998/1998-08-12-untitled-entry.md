spent most of the day duplicating a logo for the wheaton sports center; we've been trying to figure out what font they use for it, but couldn't place it. VERY frustrating, since i recognize the serifs and the distinctive curve of the 'e'... but no, I couldn't find the font's name.

so i traced it by hand in illustrator. gah. it's like raising sheep to make your own sweater.
