last year i turned twenty huddled in the recliner of a nameless motel room, cold exhausted and alone in kansas. last night, i turned twenty-one as mad max plowed through a roadblock, two psychotic s&m bikers clinging to his car's grille.

saturday morning, i started out by mauling through finances, figuring out how i can save several grand for a car by december, and generally attempting to clean up the desk. good thought, lousy follow-through.

the finances got taken care of but the desk still looks like a disaster. threw stuff into my backpack and hopped into the car to hitch a ride to jason's, after extensive IRCing via Juanita. on the way there was random discussion and i contemplated getting rainbow six by clancy. before leaving, i got a letter from allison and i took it upon myself to PINE off an answer to her. must... keep... in... touch...

arrived at jason's, told him a bit about the avengers and stuff. mom and dad milled around weirdly, apparently to talk to joyce about some stuff but she was gone and would be back in a couple minutes. after she re-arrived jason and i wandered downstairs and there were balloons and other paraphanelia... blink... and -- suddenly, the gang was moseying out of hiding places in the world's most disorganized 'SUPRIIIIIIIZE!'

it was the first suprise party i've ever had in my life... blink.

we had  blast, danny deacon ben dawn jason beck and leah... watched veggie tales, jason and ben played a punk happy birthday song they wrote, and we made chalk outlines of each others' bodies on the floor.

went out and played sardines -- jason was the first one to hide and dawn said, 'nobody find him!' ... the comment was follwed by a nervous giggle and 'just kidding...' danny and i discussed the inherent joined-at-the-hip-ness of the pair and chuckled briefly. the search continued, with ben hiding later and my location of him in a tree.

after all that jazz we hung around, ben and i went out to grab movies, and all that jazz. road warrior and 'mitchel!' were selected after great debate, and the resultes were definitely satisfactory.

while shopping for movies i had a chance to talk to ben about stuff; we had a good commiscerative rant about relationships. he talked about an old flame he'd been sure he would marry until she got pregnant with another guy -- twice, as if the first time wasn't enough... talked about how they'd met and clicked and everything. i shared some of my frustrations and he made the wry observation that, 'You're twenty-one, I'm going to be in five months... and Jason's going to be married before either of us. That's just sick, man." we laughed about it heartily.

went to borders today; i got sucked into the medical/scientific/mathematics section and before i knwe it, i'd built up a $400+ stack. I smacked myself subconsciously and realized that I had to stop, or I'd wake up broke in some gutter, buried in feynman books. i walked away with quite a few paperbacks in any case, and look forward to devouring them.

smetimes, i feel i'm a noun in search of a simile to call my own.
