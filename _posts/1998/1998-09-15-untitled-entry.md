it's rushed, but hey... i'm spend a lot more time trying to get my web page out the door. yay! by the time i nuke photoshop and illustrator and all my windows i don't have enough time or energy to pop open bbedit and hammer out a page. i'm lazy. sigh. i admit it.

yesterday went smashingly. i plowed through some stuff, wrote a touch more on the article, worked on searching for images for the kirkby site and tried to put some stuff together for it. discovered that we're locked out of the directory and spent a bit of time grappling with directory permissions to no avail.

we then ran out to denges and office depot in a fruitless search for an office chair that matched mine, for Tim. we're getting into this whole coordinating chairs thing. it's kind of cool. in the used furniture room in the back of dengees, we found a mammoth wooden desk of dark, pitted wood. pulled out the drawers and looked into it -- I didn't get a chance to take a whiff, but it looked like it should reek of cigarette smoke and spilled bourbon. a PI's desk. after we walked out I mentioned that to david and he laughed out loud in the store. "I was JUST thinking that same thing!"

we headed to taco bell to grab bites to eat and i held my ground when i insisted that it was good food. "it's the ultimate example of culinary borgification, dave. it's american mass-production assimilating another culture's food into the collective."

that afternoon the imac arrived. i was in love. dave was in love. lisa was in love. heck, the kids were in love. it was an orgy of imaccing. we set it up in a couple minutes and david played nanosaur with robby 'til lisa swatted and chased him away -- i was there until six thirty installing software and stuff. i popped in the photoshop disk before he left, and double-clicked it. it installed.

not like... we milled around and talked while it installed. just... it installed. bam. progress bar marching past -- nay, sprinting past -- and kapoof.

it was done.

i turned and looked at david. he turned and looked at me. his mouth was open. later, he told me mine was too.

i like this machine. i'm using this machine.

this morning i met tim and we all got introduced properly and acclimated; he's sort of a ham; laughs a lot and seems to get along well. reminds me -- just in a tiny way -- of Matt Balman. at age 24 of course. he dove in with edits on the howard concrete site and i was eternally grateful to him; i spent the day tracking down little problems and getting the stones jewelry goals/outline document finished up.

dave and i drove out to get memory installed in the iMac and hung around a little bit at kangaroo computer; good heavens, the iMac is a rats nest of pieces. you have to pull it apart to install the ram. evil, evil, evil. we watched the tech put it back together and conversed a bit; he was a stereotypical unix-guru looking guy; tanned and heavyset, though not in a slothfu looking way. just the microserf way. bearded with wavy hair. he didn't put it together correctly. david commented. we were discreetly steered out towards the front again. "He certainly had that technical arrogance about him, ddn't he?" david said with a laugh.

when we got back the iMac was all RAM'd up but the soudn didn't work. we sighed, pulled it apart and found a loose ribbon cable. ta-daaaaa. all fixed. we rock.

other random events: tim was mercilessly grilled about his SO by lisa. wah-wah-wah-waahhhhh. he got his first call from bob wheeler, who's going to become his new best friend. and we traded tips and tech for the 1400. yayay.

i came home and worked more on the mongoose page; i'm really really happy with the way it's coming together. soon, i think, it'll be ready for prime time. i just need more content now. sigh. but at least i'm working on it! in the old days i didn't even bother plodding through it after a certain point. i think it helps that i do it after work; it lets me chew it in little bits and never get completely sick and tired of it.

talked to tragedy again. she had to leave and she said that she was very sad that she had to head out. she enjoyed taling to me. *sigh*

damn. i don't know if i have or want to kick the whole crush thing. it's so ... safe, if nothing else. i don't understand it. why do i have to feel torn? i'm just being shallow, the way i ragged on jason in kansas.

but i really do care for her. and I *would* like to get to know her more. and talk to her. and the whole deal... i just... I don't know what she is looking for NOW. what she is feeling NOW. it scares me because i don't want to hurt her, i don't want to lead her on... but i don't want to lose her friendship either.

and quite honestly i would be lying if i said i didn't want a relationship with her. but i would be lying just as much if i said I *DID*... i am attracted to her but i feel like there isn't enough beneath it yet to make it something that would last. and that scares me, too. have i wrecked my chance at friendship, really, by letting this come into play? maybe. I don't know.

it's something to pray about.
