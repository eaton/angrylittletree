worked. work work work. see jeff. see jeff work. work, work, work!

sloshing through the trackone stuff at robis, and juggling information on toyota corollas. scott palmer, a car dealer who's been feeding me good info on geos and toyotas for a while, called early in the morning with a Corolla DX a ways away.

last night alison asked an out of the blue question. where she stood, in relation to my other female friends. i can't even remember everything i said. i wish i knew. i talked to her and things seemed fine, i thought they did at least, after we prayed. i asked god to help us both know what he was saying and to keep our eyes on him and help us to seek his heart for wisdom regardless of our preconceived desires or ideas or whatever. she prayed with me and asked him for wisdom and everything. whatever.

that was yesterday.

DAMNIT

why, god? why can't i do anything right?

before going to check out the car i bopped in to check mail. she was there. mentioned she missed me. and in a slight continuation of a previous conversation mentioned why she didn't even mind the distance between us. didn't mind geographical separation.

she said that shes willing to wait for the real thing. that she has known guys who were some of the things she wanted. men of God, but nothing more. gentle, but not men of God. interested in her, but that's all... she said that she was beginnig to think that i might be her package deal. but that she was afraid to scare me away talking too serious like that.

she asked what my thoughts thoughts were. are. on what she said.

i didn't know. i still don't know. i'm confused. i pray, and all i know is that i hear eight million voices telling me everything and nothing at all. i tried to answer but just got tangled deeper into a mire of confusing "i don't knows" and "i'm praying and don't know what he's sayings" and all of that.

she ... i don't know what she thinks. i checked out the car and felt the words weighing on me for the hour long drive. it was a beautiful car, but more expensive than i'd planned. more commitment than i'd anticipated. a different route.

i don't know. everything is happening.

fuck me.

why did i hug her? why did i touch her hand? i don't know. i was stupid. i should cut myself off until i know i'm supposed to marry someone and hope for the best. this isn't some GAME. this is alison's heart and that's not something i can SCREW with for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. she is not a practice run to see how well i understand how relationships WORK.

i don't get it. i hate myself right now, i'm ready to put my fist through a wall in hopes of making pain that will stay with me for days. i am not ready for a relationship. emotionaly. psychologically. whatever. i can't handle it, that much is obvious from this. but damnit, i want that connection. and i let that conflict pull me, i dropped my guard and she saw how i felt and she read it. DAMN...

she asked me to pray for her when she left, that she would be open to god's voice. because the devil was trying to get to her. tell her she was not worthwhile. things she knew weren't true but had trouble not listening to.

damnit. she is hurting and it is my fault. my fault because i didn't hold back, steel myself and stay aloof and caring-but-distant. or something like that. i can't say anything to mom; she'd just say something solemn about how i hurt alison and should really pray for her. or something.

i don't know what iam supposed to do. i can't just jump into a relationship. i look into the future and see dawn and jason and i turn away in disgust. i look at what i know, what i have now, and i am confused. i want to go back to crushes on people who are impossible to pursue. i want to go back to where it's safe and i don't have to worry about the implications of things. i want to be the one who getes hurt, damnit! not someone else!

i'm exhausted, stumbling to bed screaming curses at myself in my head and wishing the people i care for would just leave. or not care back. or something. goodnight.
