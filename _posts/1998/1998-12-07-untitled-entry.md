mirrorshades is slowly but surely taking shape, and I am relishing the thought of its completion. It's slow going, though, as I seem incapable of generating more than one room description per day. This is, of course, an unacceptable state of affairs that must be remedied.

work proceeded as usual, with me trekking on through the kirkby site -- tweaks to existing pages and another fruitless attempt to add contact to the individual financial services page. i flung myself at Illustrator and put together a handful of logo designs for Stoplight Coffee; every one a logo i can be proud of. next priority is the honing of the kirkby stuff, and the modifications to the TrackOne manual.

Nate's work world seems far more surreal than mine... "I have about a month or two before my civility runs out, Jeff... it's that bad." Steve, the official bearer of pointy hair at Logicware, is oozing cluelessness in a variety of ways and making things difficult. Nate attempts to avoid with limited success.

He does, however, want to stick around long enough to port his next project -- ******.  It is, of course, the killer resume project. So killer that its name was stricken from my very journal. And he'd like to steer the promotion of it to Robis. That would be /wicked/ slick.

Went out to dinner with dad and had the Sampler Platter of Dhooom. I came home with a full order of mozerella sticks for tomorrow's lunch. sheesh! I'm not complaining, though... mozerella sticks are a food group unto themselves.

relationship foo is pleasantly distant; meaning, i haven't had to think about anything concrete for at least 24 hours. Alison is talking about interviewing with PaxTV on Tuesday... Good heavens. That means tomorrow. Sigh... How to deal with it? Marin's suggestion meshes with Nate's: tell her there's no chance, ever. Anything less would give hope, when there shouldn't be. Of course, they said it in a slightly less pessimistic fashion.

random visitors appear in our offices, looking for the lawyers: today, jerry arrived and was ready to chew us out for leaving the doors open. lo and behold, we had locked up when /we/ left. leaving the curious question floating in the air: who the heck unlocked the doors?
