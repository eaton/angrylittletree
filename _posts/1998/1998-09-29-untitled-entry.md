crap, my shoulder is hurting. it's not the sharp 'oh, make it stop' kind of thing that you can wince at really. just a dull headache-inducing throb that started at the point of the shot and crept around the grip my shoulder. it wasn't bad in the morning... but by mid afternoon i felt like my body was dulled.

last night talked to sara briefly. there was a discussion about spiritual gifts and she asked if i had the gift of celibacy. i blinked, then chuckled -- "If I did, I would think I'd be better at it..." She laughed and said, fair enough. Later i asked her why she'd said that.

"You just seem so... monk-like," she answered. "I don't know why."

maybe I am meant to be celibate or something like that. God's done stranger things throughout history, I guess. Wouldn't be too shocking if I were to discover that i'm wired for a solitary life. i spent a little while searching celibacy related links and FAQs and stuff like that. they were good for a laugh, and the jokes about pros and cons were witty. "Number Nine: You'll be a much more effective international superspy." but *shrug* i don't know.

i went to bed feeling not too shabby and woke up this morning feeling decidedly strange. odd dreams i only remember snatchlets of, and weird omens. i woke up feeling that i was late, and my alarm went off the moment my feet touched the floor. got off to work and arrived a few minutes before tim; odd these days. finished the last bits on the guide; i'm very very happy with it. david tried to add some terms to it and expressed a deeper respect for the hellish work i'd done compiling it. we all chuckled.

went to the bavarian inn and discovered that tim is even more bizarre than he appears in the office... his track team antics caused the same sort of wide-eyed looks that i'm used to receiving. in any case... he was introduced to the wonderful world of the bavarian inn.

china*blue talked to me this evening. last night she said that talking to me was like reading a play by some author i'd never heard of. the author of waiting for godot, i think. "it's like seeing all of the present and none of the background," she said. she explained that she had been telling a friend about this 'person she knows on the internet' -- yours truly. and as she tried to tell them bout me she realized that she knew nothing about me, really. that i was a phenomena, a person with no past, only the present.

it reminded me of something kristin said a couple years ago -- january 8th or something like that, on starstones when we got talking about dragons and impressing and all of that. she said that i keep to myself. that i share who i am but not who i've been.

aimless rambling now.

the 'crush' on kristin has thankfully faded to an uncomfortable memory and i've hopefully exorcised the attraction to alison. tossed it in a metaphorical boat and sent it, blazing, on to valhalla. so now i'm left with unfocused desires for connection and the whole deal.

went to borders tonight. got a big book of pictures about havana... and dr laura's 'ten stupid things men do to mess up their lives.' came home and read a page about primes in nucleotide strings and music, the meanings of numbers. i was visitor 666 to the page.

came home and thought deeply. i feel like i'm teetering on the precipice... i do not know where i'm going but i know that itwill be interesting.
