i listened to 'in your eyes' on the way to work and gritted my teeth. i've talked to friends about it but i don't know if i've ever said it here, flat out.

i'm attracted to kristin richardson.

damn.

i try to quantify the 'why' and end up just banging my head, muppets-composer-style, on the keyboard. the sense of humor. the energy and the creativity. the vision to see the pixie hiding beneath every flower and the dragon sleeping 'neath every hill. the yearning that she has for something that transcends the here and now. the desire to *touch*.

"are there any people in the world who can cry that there is no magic, and laugh at the muppets, and smile at the stars?" she once groused rhetorically. i typed, 'sounds like nate.' and laughed a bit, choking because it had taken an act of will not to type 'sounds like me.'

i remember one night, sitting in the dim light of my bedroom and listening to her words in my headphones. she talked for hours, it seemed, and every word was a treasure because it was something from /her/. something from her heart.

she was quiet -- whispering into the mic of her tape recorder late at night, sharing the kinds of thoughts that you can only share in the dark. talking about how she had seen kennedy on an A&E documentary, thought about how he had captured people's hearts and minds and spirits and turned them to something he knew was important. all the things that he accomplished, the people he inspired... but he started with so much. and how could she ever hope to accomplish anything like that? since she was just kristin richardson from a tiny town in iowa.

if i were to point to a moment when i started falling for her -- no, when i started loving her -- that would be it. when i heard her say those things and roll the quiet agony over in her mind, whispering in the dark in a small sunflower-smelling room in iowa.

i want to gather her up and shield her, smooth her hair and remind her everything will be alright. but i don't know that it will be. it hurts. 

i'm listening to 'sister, mother' by sixpence none the richer.

i want to kick it, but it just isn't happening. i want to shed this stupid magnetic pull like an old skin, but it clings, filmy, to my thoughts and feelings and actions.

well. it's nighttime now and i look back at THAT little bit of angst with wide-eyed wonder. what the heck was THAT... *moof* in any case, I'm frightened today. Because i got letters from the singles service. from someone in wheaton. fear. fear and loathing. aieeee!

went to the store, picked up the 77's Sticks And Stones, Dakoda Motor Company's Into The Sun, and The Rise Of Endymion.

in other news i haven't heard from alison. i wonder if the mail just isn't going through, or if she's neglecting it. I shouldn't complain, really -- i went ages without answring her letters.

must sleep.

enjoyed drivand loved my compilation tape while i was out. 'our untamed hearts' is perfect driving music...

mom foudn the singles database. searched it. i fear, now -- she discovered a 21 year old southern belle that looks like a model and is a full blooded republican with a law degree. fleeeee.
