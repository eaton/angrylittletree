woo!

maybe i just got more  sleep today. but it seems a little brighter. the iMac (unamed, i now realize... this must be remedied soon) now has a psychadelic background and a picture of the scooby-doo gang on the desktop. i think, perhaps, that i shall name it the mystery machine.

over lunch, scooby doo discussions ruled the office. the concensus? velma rocks my world! no one was really able to figure out what the heck daphne was there for, but lisa AHA'd!' at my comment. "You know... Daphne and Fred always disappear to 'investigate,' but they never come up with anything. Dont' you think that's just a leeeeeetle odd? perhaps?"

conspiracy is afoot.

"Hey!" i said. "you know... the lawyer that disappeared. he is JUST the sort of person who would dress up as a swamp monster to scare away prospective renters! this isn't pulp fiction... it's an episode of scooby doo!" lisa just stared at me with her distinctive, trademarked bemused look of 'i-don't-think-so-ness.'

spent the rest of my lunch hour sucking up scooby doo pages, downloading GIFs, and the like. now the computer says, 'jinkies!' when i boot it. woo woo!

a letter from kristin arrived in my email box, soon to be the sole domain of microsoft. (i'm converting to the client of the beast, outlook express). she is busy as all get out, and just got cornerstone pictures developed.  she mentioned, after her busy schedule woes, that 'I guess God is looking out for me." it made me sit up a bit straighter; think, perhaps, that she is starting to think of Him as being /here/... not out there. Uncaring. I'm praying more...

i found a diary entry i wrote in 1996, IIRC. i, the wise 18 year old, outlined the timeline for my future relationships based on the national median age of marriage, and (being the thoughtful lad I was) corrected for the skewing effect that cohabitation has on those numbers. in alison's words, "You have too much time on your hands, jeff."

i saw the list of qualities, character traits, etc that i wanted to work on. that i thought were 'must-haves' before i even considered getting into a relationship. i looked back and thought... wow. there's actual improvement. God is faithful.

*boggle*

i said in that document that i only had until mid 1999. i've gotten a little derailed along the way, but... hey. looks like i still have a chance, with His help. *smile* today is a strange day.evening. i feel... i don't know. i feel as if i have begun to recorrect the drift in my course over the last few months. not something that's easy to articulate. i shall think and write more on it later.

golly, mukala rocks!

working on the mirrorshades soundtrack. going to sleep. tomorrow morning tim and i schmooze with the chamber of commerce. oi! [random note to think about later. ti'ms women problems.]
