i'm a little tired as i write this, so my words and thoughts are colored by the tug towards sleep. friday was an interesting if uneventful day, marked by kirkby site renovations, some minor fruitful tweaks to the hydro-flow documentation, and lunch at giordano's with tim and lisa. much discussion during the hour, including revelation of robby davoust's dark side. ("So I see him and his cousing out at the end of the driveway with their pants down... I run out and I scream, 'What are you /doing/?' And he says, 'Oh, we're peein' at cars as they pass by!' Then his cousin's mom says, 'Mark, I told you not to do that anymore!'")

the office is official, now, and we'll be moving into it on the 14th. huzzah huzzah.

after work i cruised home listening to B96 and realizing once again that bass does not good music make. deacon and dawn and jason were off to a ghoti hook concert until late, so i drove to aurora and nabbed danny. we wandered and hung around and boggled at the strangeness of my driving my own car. talked about relationships and i briefly tried to explain what was up with alison. listened to abbey road and ear candy on my stereo and gloated about the lack-of-getting-lost.

"You were nice, sane people," danny said of alison and i. "You weren't trying to eat each other." the conversation topics led to much laughing and bonding when danny and i were in the car, but i couldn't get un-confused.

i miss being on the cusp of love, or something like that. i feel like curling up and never coming out, for loneliness. the only person in a decade who's been attracted to me. and i cut it off. at lest friends won't have to hear me complain anymore... i have no license to now. *laugh* being wanted is a drug -- i'm trying to go cold turkey.

we waited in ambush at the scotts for jason and deacon to drive up -- they did, and admired the corolla. more talk, more stuff. visited wal-mart at 2am to get phone cord, and danny and i got into a mock-scuffle over who controlled the jukebox buttons at the music display. "Funk rock!" "Noooo, 80's pop!" "Funk!" "Pop!" Jason and Deacon pulled us apart.

back at the scott ranch, the girls were doing their girl things upstairs and we did our guy things downstairs. music was composed, we watched raiders of the lost ark and that thing you do. danny and i both passed out while deac and jason composed new riffs. regained consciousness late-ish (night-time late, not morning late) and groggily troubleshooted modem init strings while that thing you do played in the background.

at six danny was shaken awake and we drove to denny's, screaming and shivering in the morning cold. frost made lawns crunchy-white, and it was a definite rude wake-up to bodies that wanted to sleep. deacon turned around and looked at me and said, "But just imagine the stories this will make! It's so perfect!" danny chattered his teeth affirmatively, head invisible since he'd wrapped his overcoat around his body like a zipped up sleeping bag. the chattering was his teeth.

after bacon and eggs and hash browns and coffee coffee coffee coffee, we slumped back and danny and i passed out again. around one in the afternoon we woke up again, ate captain crunchberries, and watched reruns of Who's The Boss while muttering wittily.

jason and deac never bothered sleeping.

the rest of the day blurs together like smudged oil paint: alison's mother is doing well after the surgery. i picked up a chicagoland atlas at borders to avoid getting lost. i drove more and then drove some again.

nate called -- talked to him and we laughed. he's being stressed more and more by the logicware situation; he asked some poking probing questions about robis, then allowed that he might be asking about our PR services in the future. "At present our PR work is... well, it isn't." that would be cool; intensely cool. we talked a little bit about relationship type stuff; i can't even remember all that i said.

i'm tired, now, and i miss being wanted. i miss being wanted by someone i thought that i could be something with. i miss being warm against someone. i miss someone being filled a little more by me. pathetic. narcissist. i guess, really, that remembering that more than anything else shows that my motivations were wrong in the first place. kind of depressing really.

i was the one who ditched it. not her. "If you never take a chance, you'll be alone forever," someone said to me. i feel like crying. fuck it. i'll live with it. it's easier than trying to balance.
