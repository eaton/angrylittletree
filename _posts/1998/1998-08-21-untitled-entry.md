i've been 21 for.... ummmm... almost a week now. had to get a new chair for work today, the old one self-destructed and now operates like a tilt and swivel monitor stand. tres funky.  also tres difficult to SIT on. soooo, we went shopping and nabbed a nice one that didn't cose too much.

back at the circle R, a discussion ensued about Tim, the new potential third-man-at-Robis. he's got a powerbook 1400cs and a digital camera...

[time passes]

the rest of this is being written monday evening; i'm slipping, i suppose, which i hate. the weekends always end up being harder to make these entries on, or at least harder than they were when i had mel around. which is another story, which i'll get to in time...

after getting back to work from the office supply store a conversation started in the office about who i should be fixed up with. Lisa and David went back and forth with various names for a while and I had to make frightened noises.

"What about so-and-so?"
"Dave! Jail-bait..."
"What? How old is she?"
"Fifteen! I'd say so-and-so, but she's engaged now..."
"She's thirty! She's 50% older than Jeff!"

it started getting out of hand around that point. after work i bamfed to jason's and we all hung around there; danny and deacon and beck were there and we watched say anything and listened to music and they composed and we went out to grab pizza. jason was like... seething under the surface all night for reasons i'll never understand. you could see it in his eyes, the way he'd challenge people with this knock-it-off-my-shoulder-if-you-dare kind of look. just... coiled spring. danny insists it's because dawn wasn't there.

we all went out and got pizza when we found out everything else was closed, and ate it in the rain out on beck's deck.

night fell and the four of us guys watched some doctor who, they composed music, i read burning chrome and globalhead. i watched them as they thrashed through the bassline and all that... it's like watching through glass. it's something i know i'll never be able to do, but wish i could. to pick up an instrument and make /sound/ come /out/ of it. i fell asleep late, with ransom playing on the vcr and the growing crunch of the guitars pressing against my eardrums.

when we all finally regained consciousness it was rather late; eleven in the morning. i fiddled with a new short story; deacon liked it quite a bit and i was fond of it. i'm going to be trying to push it out into something longer. if i judge it correctly it may end up somewhere in the 5K-8K word range. we walked to dawn's house for reasons i'm not really sure of, with jason on his rollerblades and the rest of us on foot. finally, at last, he headed out to take danny and deacon back, and i caught a ride back home.

scraped paint back at homee; after twenty minutes or so, with massivivid pounding in my ears via discman, my arms were white with paint flecks and my biceps were killing me. nothing hurts as bad as pressing 'up' on something for a long time. there's no easy way to scrape off the underside of the overhang, alas. called lynelle to touch base after some of that -- actually called several times and got the answering machine to no avail. third call, i got through and talked to her -- for quite a while, actually. whenever i see her in person she has this poised look, like she's ready to narrow her eyes at you and blow you off if things go the way she doesn't like. maybe that's going too far, describing it like that... but she has an air of it. on the phone it falls away, and she sounds younger, out of her shell. just a voice, with uncertainty and anxiey and fear tinged into the sounds of her words.

we talked about how she was doing, what she was hoping for... nothing major heavy duty, but that's how it goes. justin, jason's friend, wants to date her... and she's rather uncomfortable about that -- or seemed to be over the phone. she hemmed and hawwed and stuff, and it took me a minute to realize what she was saying. thickjeff(tm!) but it was interesting. i traded the story about lisa and dave deciding who to fix me up with and she laughed.

saturday came to an undramatic end, with a conclusion i don't recall.

sunday, made it to church and hooked up with stan briefly. it was uneventful, seeing as how i don't remember a whit of it, though i noticed an eye-catching member of the opposite sex across the sanctuary at the beginning of the service. my eye kept wandering back, for no apparent reason save my inherent maleness, and after the service as i went up to talk to joyce. see what was up with jason. she was talking to said eye catching female and introduced us. she's a communications/literature major. the world needs more of them!

the rest of the day consisted of me playing phone tag with everyone in the known universe trying to get something together, and finally conceding defeat. asked lynelle if she wanted to go out and grab something to eat and talk, then swing by and see if the gang was back, but she took a rain check or something along those lines: had to eat dinner with the capras.
