are we in the dog days yet?

David davoust got back today, with a slight cold. we're cranking along and things are moving. dad might be offered a 'buy-out' package at work. a thirty-thousand dollar plus severance package. we don't know, though. it came as kind of a sudden suprise, and we're all sort of in limbo trying to figure out what's up and how to (possibly) deal with things.

i got home and waded through old email tonight... stuff from one, two years ago. old conversations with kristin. mail from milisia. letters from tammy, notes from mike riddle. i feel so strange afterwards, like i've just dropped into some sort of under-water mood.

does that make any sense? probably not, considering how tired i am right now. it's like... like when you pull yourself under the surface of the water, and open your eyes. suddenly everything is different, muted, tinted. deeper and more intimate somehow. 'bullet the blue sky' is playing on roxanne right now and it's complementing the groove in a weird way, somekind of emotional harmonic.

I call it the itch.

It's not too original, admittedly. Nothing catchy or exceptionally witty about it. But 'the itch' is exactly what it is. The thing that keeps me going. The thing that makes me want to write, to shape bodies and faces and souls of ot the clay of words.

what will they do when i let them out of my hand? the people that i make. what will they discover? what will they learn to hate, or love, or wish they had done? i don't know. the wondering digs just under my skin...

the itch.

so i pick up my pen.

and i write.

they do their thing, and i do mine. they act, i watch. i record it and shape it and finesse it, watching their gestures and sighs and smirks and kisses and wishing that these people i make could find someone else to give them breath. because my hands get tired but my mind never does.

but i keep writing.

that's the itch.

from several months ago, found tonight:

<blockquote>[GreyScale] Tero: It's a WHOLE different thing, lemme just tell ya.  I'm afraid. Honestly, man.  There's a line, and once it's crossed, there is no going back...
[GreyScale] Jeff tilts his head and listens.
[GreyScale] Tero sighs and decides to be straightforward.
[GreyScale] Jeff arches a brow and listens.
[GreyScale] Tero: Jeff, don't lose your virginity.  k?
[GreyScale] Jeff twitches his nose, just to get it in on the action. And blinks.
[GreyScale] Jeff mulls. "OK..."
[GreyScale] Tero: Yeah, well.  I doubt i would take the advice myself.  Okay, whatever.
[GreyScale] Jeff: Beats my friend Lev, whose persistent advice is, "you need to get laid, jeff, you know that? That's your problem. You need to get laid more."
[GreyScale] Tero: Yeah, and you know what?  You do.  Then you become like all teh other jerks out there.  I feel it man, it's like it's creeping over my fucking shoulder.  I refuse to be this kinda predator thing, and yet I feel this sickening desire to just say forget morality and being a nice guy and go for it...
[GreyScale] Tero: There's a dark side to us all.  And I am afraid of mine, 'cause I've felt it and I've seen it.  
[GreyScale] Tero: Sorry man.  That's kinda heavy, and I can't say I've worked through it all myself.  But I kinda wanted it out there.
