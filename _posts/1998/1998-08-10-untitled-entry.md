saw deep impact tonight with Tammy and I was blown away. both of us were. morgan freeman was astounding. there was a self-sacrificial male protagonist. it wasn't a disaster movie. it was a movie about people. forgiveness. love.

the fifteen year old main character (one of them at least) married the girl he likeed -- loved -- to save her. so he could take her and her parents with him into the shelters. they coulnd't come, she stayed and they got separated. he left the shelter to go find her again...

it was... wow. i'm at a loss for words, but it's a beautiful and profoundly moving filom. it tosses out no self-aggrandizing cliches ala independence day.

elisa's mom attempted to overdose today; i found out as i came home in the afternoon. china*blue is in love with a confused transexual, and is trying to work through that as he works through his life. kristin is reading the celestine prophecy and liking it.

i'm tired, and i feel that life is moving too quickly for my liking.

in five days i will be the age of my father when he married my mother.

i watched the movie and thought, as everyone did i think, what i would do given four weeks to the end of life on earth. the death of everyone. save me and 999,999 other lucky ones.

who would i see? what woudl i do? how would i prepare, say goodbye? i foudn myself thinking of kristin. i hated myself for it.
