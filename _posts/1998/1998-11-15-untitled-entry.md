busy day!

church, talking about gossip in sunday school with a large crowd. brian's girlfriend was there, and looked OLD. not like, unattractively old but just blinkworthily old compared to brian.

sat next to susan harp in church, who was absolutely buzzed from a cappucino and was very wacky. it's nice knowing there are other deranged people in the church.

came home, got hit on by a guest on lambdamoo after starting a discussion about plastic explosives and detonator technology. "invite me somewhere private and listen to me tick?" it wouldn't be noteworthy, except it was such a smooth segue from the topic. impressive! annoying but impressive in a 'had to see it happen to believe it could be done' kind of way.

went back to chuch to meet for the planning session for the outreach in december. beckie is so /wired/ sometimes! heh. christy stole my driving cap and wore it, and made us all talk to a feather-headed handd puppet named 'Bob Marley' instead of her. "No. Talk to the /puppet/. The PUPPET!"

hung out with stan and susan harp during the Y2K seminar and agape feast (aka pig-out). susan was on ANOTHER cappucino and we feared for her. it was funny, though. quotes of the night:

"We're making a tiny little person and adding it to the collective. We're naming it Three of Three." -- Chad, announcing his wife's pregnancy.

"I dunno, PK. You were really harsh on that whole stockpiling guns and ammo thing..."  --me, after the Y2K talk.

brian returned my cd, AND gave me a big mukala poster. WOO HOO! talked to alison and *startle* God /does/ answer prayer. the thing we prayed about last night has been answered... the guy foudn some other girl to seek. he wasn't a Christian, and ker-blink ker-blink, problem solved. alison and i talked a little bit about how hard it is sometimes seeing that 'wantedness' vanish, even when you didn't want to pursue the relationship.

after a while we parted, and she said that God has been really doing some great things in her life. with help from my insights. or something like that. i can't remember her words, but... it boggled me. made me grin hugely, the whole works. i must sleep now, but i'm smiling wryly.
