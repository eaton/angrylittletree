yay.

spent time on the phone with fred grenning of hydro-flow, the fire hydrant people. shockingly, he's positive about the manual and things are moving along. we'll be moving into the office on saturday, DSL service is being turned on, and the PC's network card is installed but inoperative. hmm. we shall prevail!

outside, the wind was HORRENDOUS. thunderous. lean-15-degrees-into-it. drove home in the pitch dark to find a powerless house. we ate tunafish and rice in the darkness, and i managed to call sara and talk a bit -- no dice. although i'd like to see her, there's no chance of going out in weather like /this/... the fact that my map of the route was on mapsonus DID contribute admittedly.

it was strange, walking around town square wheaton. leaning against the wind, alone and anonymous. it made me think of movies, and diaries. and then i realized that diaries are what i can actually write.

i wonder if that's my muse. finding a vibe and diary-writing to it. *smile*

alison is exhausted; i feel closer to her when we talk without that 'relationship' around. it's a more natural closeness. and i'm treasuring it.

o/` oh, down in the boon-docks... down in the boon-docks...people put me down 'cause that's the side of town i was born on... o/`
