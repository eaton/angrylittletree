woke up late this morning and spent a few hours segueing in and out of consciousness with thoughts of poetry and stories and html and deadlines drifting through my mind. i dreamed things i can't remember.

after i slagged out of bed i did the obligatory morning startup routine and manged o get out and start scraping paint by three-ish. it's exercise, i told myself, and was actually able to enjoy the rhythm of it. there's a certain beauty in submerging yourself like that; putting the whole of your being into the blunt edge of the scraper, picking at cracking paint, working the flat metal under the peeling surface. something pure and simple and simpler than the rest of life.

i think of why people go into something like carpentry; it seems so beautiful to me. i submerge myself in pixels and tags and dowload ratios. they submerge themselves in the scrape of a plane on hard wood, stain soaking into the grain and the harsh touch of a lathe.

as much as i tell myself that i'm a craftsman, or aspire to be one, i realize that their art can be so much more beautiful than keys on a keyboard or phosphor on a screen. it can touch the body with its beauty. it gives calouses on the heels of the carpenter's palms, a splinter in his thumb. the most a webmaster can think of is CTS.

saw the wedding singer, and i decided i loved it. what a gorgeously angsty movie!
