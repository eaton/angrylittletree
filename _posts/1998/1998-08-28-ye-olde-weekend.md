huzzah! not a very eventful day, what with the lack of friend-interaction and such, but it was a good one. FINALLY -- thank God! -- hammered down al lbut the last details on the c9 construction job, which took almost the entire day.

yesterday we got an extremely odd, random fax... a single handwritten page. "Robis. we have heard of you and want to know if you can help us..." it was on fax letterhead from 'john bennet' but signed jennifer... the numbers at the bottom of the page had been scratched out., leaving only the area codes. it was a company in south carolina... and that's all that it said.

i turned to david and said, "You know... this is how all good mysteries start." he blinked at me and chuckled. "You know... you're right. it is."

after work i biked home, had a pile of pretzels, and we mad it to barnes and noble to pick up car books. along the way i swiped "the fall of hyperion' and 'endymion' -- i'm looking forward to cracking the shrike mystery once and for all. i saw a girl at blockbuster that made me blink and swallow... not sure how to explain it but she reminded me of kristin in some under-the-surface way. straight dark-dark-brown hair, past her shoulders and catching the light like silk. a pair of dark thick-rimmed glasses like her shades, dressed all in dark and wearing thick-soled sandals. she was thin -- i'm tempted to say delicate, but she never once looked weak... her fingers were strong... she looked through books with an appraising eye and never glanced my way, thankfully. her lips turned down half a touch at the corners. i grabbed for a book mindlessly and made myself walk away.

i went to blockbuster after that, and roamed the aisles in search of entertainment. for some reason i was acutely aware of the various couples, fingers laced together as they followed the curves of the new releases section.

i remembered the girl's lips, that slight thoughtful pout, something that made me think of my own expression. i looked in the pale mirror of a window, and realized that i was scowling; i wondered if i always looked like that.

i hoped not.
