things are going well, mocked up the C9 site's internal look and feel beyond the main page. it's looking nice and classy, in my not so humble opinion. wink wink.

things are really getting crazy with work, more jobs and stuff, and david is seriously looking into adding another person. only problem is, we're getting lots of work but no cash. if this keeps up for two more months, we'll be switting pretty when the money flows in. of course, we'll be unconscious, too. but that's another matter.

resume came in today before i headed out for lunch -- a media/public relations major with an emphasis on sociology. one of her projects in college was developing a marketing plan for cheez wiz. it's good that i wasn't a part of that; i'd have come up with something truly truly deranged. or at least, i like to think so.

listened to faithmassive at work. it's a pity there are no similarly musically-minded folks. lesigh.

car's tire is flat, rain is pouring. murphy's law.

[time passes]

early evening now, just got home with a dull headach creeping around my neck. i did the math: five to ten minutes in the rain changing a tire, or two and a half minutes at top speed to get to work on my bike. no contest. i grabbed an instant poncho, whipped it on, and i was off.

more busy work, not a lot of 'accomplishment feelings' but stuff got done. we've got a site mockup to show C9 if they want to see it -- the 'main page' and stuff like that. woo woo.
