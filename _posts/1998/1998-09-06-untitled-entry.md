work went well, with the persistent feeling that we were actually getting things done. dave and i thoroughly discussed hyperion, the nature of time debt, and the first book's amusing similarity to the canturbury tales.

there's a weird aura at times; dan, his brother, is in the process of splitting up with his wife and their kids are in the middle.

i left early after lunch and swung by G&G, nabbed a hershey' dark chocolate bar and a few packs of lemonheads: when he got back the chocolate was offered as supplication to the management.

the evening kicked off with a trip to jason's -- a going-away party for beck, with deacon and danny and dawn and jason and i in attendance. a miniscule kitten was also present for the festivities, in deacon's tender care. it was an amazingly cute little thing that he found; apparently it was a neighbor's. dawn was all over it; feeding it with an eyedropper as we all oooohed and aaahhed and siiiighed.

it was amazing. tiny squeaky mews, lusty tugging at the eyedropper of thick whole milk. needle-clawed paws no bigger than my fingertip waving in the air as she tried to find a foothold. fluffed-up fur that made her tiny body seem a bit bigger. everyone talked quietly when they were holding her; stroking gently as she squeaked for Dawn again.

danny and i watched in abject horror as jason, then deacon tried on beck's button-up floral dress. jason vogued, and we all made disgusted noises -- Dawn finally walked over and started unbuttoning it. I turned to danny and said, "there are just whole layers of wrongness to the words, 'Dawn is unbottoning Jason's dress.'" He nodded, wide-eyed, and groaned. "It's just /dripping/ with wrongness..."

finally, deacon sat around with shades and the dress and a sun hat nd played the piano til the pizza guy arrived. then went to the door and pulled the twenty out of the neck of the dress, and offered it to him. "We know, we know," said Jason to the pizza guy. "But we don't have the /slightest/ why he's wearing that hat."

General partying ensued, and I grooved to the Land of Misfits EP by joy electric. at one point I was dancing to the aphex-ish mix of i'm your boy, and deacon marvled to beck. "I just want to know... what's holding him /up/?"

other stuff followed. pizza, garlic sauce, music and gratuitous petra. we all trekked out to the park around 11PM, and danny and i kept a running stream of snappy patter about dawn and jason. it's scary how... linked they're becoming. we joked that there's a repulsor field forming around them that only heacy-bore cynicism weapons can penetrate. seriously, though... I don't know, it's creepy. after we all drove around dropping people off, i was in the back sacked out while jason and dawn were in the front, fingers laced together. they talked about the kind of house they wanted and i felt prickly-cold premonition running up my back.

after we got back to jason's house i crashed; passed out and didn't wake up for almost eleven hours. by that time, i had to split for home.

saturday was uneventful, save nate's revelation: he joined a singles service online. fear! fear and loathing! i succumbed and filled out my own profile; we were both laughing our heads off til the wee hours of the morning at the whole thing.

sunday: less eventful, and quite fun. talked to rolando and chad and a new guy from ACE team at church, and grooved with stan when i discovered that (lo!) aleixa's new cd is out. came home and flew a kite; must remember to describe the sensations later. i remember dad's giant delta flapping in the air as it tried to fill its wings with wind, looking for all the world like a robed mystic spinning in the sky. my metaphor generator is overheating.

RP'd a bit and started making evil that night; it carried over to today, monday, when i whipped up a new puppet called karin. the embodiement of the techno-divinator concept i was tossing around a while ago. i got the feel for it and suddenly, I can run with a new sketch. she's the girl i saw in kansas, the mask of disinterest with a cat's balance. she's the totem figure of the story i'm working on... and she could be just another random mood shift. c'est la vie.

the singles engine found me a perfect 100% match -- me. wah-wah-wah-waahhhhh...

talked to china*blue about luv stuff. she was sympathetic, and caring, and angsting about her own stuff as well.
