i'm getting way too into this compilation tape stuff. after the semi-success of the 'flip side' compilation, i'm brimming with ideas for more stuff. i want to do thick, mood-inducing comps. i just have to figure out what moods i want to induce. hoi!

i need to figure out the absolute best way to kill a crush. effective, repeatable, etc. i could bottle it and sell it for millions. i scribbled most of this in my diary on paper, sitting in higher ground with a bottle of A&W -- it's definitely not virgil's, but it's good enough to write with. the conversation i had with china*blue this evening was odd... liberating, almost. she made a comment at one point that simply GRABBED me, it was so right. she said that she wanted to see me happily attached, but wouldn't feel right fixing someone up with me. i told her, now you understand.

(from Blue Atrium) China*Blue sighs a bit more ... you know, I'd love to see you happily attatched to someone, but having spent a relatively long time very closely attatched to someone whose heart/mind etc. were focused on someone else (from Blue Atrium) China*Blue shrugs ... it's not a nice position.

[i grinned. "You don't want to inflict me on anyone ;)]

(from Blue Atrium) China*Blue sighs. I was anticipating that response as soon as I pressed enter.

(from Blue Atrium) China*Blue nods.

China*Blue pages, "I'm feeling rather helpless at the moment, because in a sense the answer is - yes, I don't think that allowing someone to get strongly attatched to you while you are yearning for someone else is a good idea (not that you may have much choice)"

China*Blue pages, "On the other hand... being with someone else can be key to breaking another attatchment or its unhappy parts."

[ i explained that now she understood why i felt the way that i do. and why i was holding back from anything involving romance... because i wouldn't want someoen i cared for falling for me ]

(from Blue Atrium) China*Blue sighs. Admittedly, it is. And few wouldtake it for honesty, despite the fact that you are being sincere.

China*Blue pages, "It is also avery mature response."

China*Blue pages, "suppressing the basic human need for acceptance and affection from others is great self-denial, IMHO, not to mention a special sign of friendship if you're limiting yourself so as to not inflict pain on others"


i wouldn't WANT someone i cared for falling for me. and she understood it. she understood WHY. she understood why i've been soooo... weird about relationships for so long. wanting to connect with someone but not being willing to use someone i care for as a 'distraction'. and it made sense to her. she didn't just brush it off or call me a martyr or say i should just go 'meet someone'. she just GOT it, and smiled and nodded sadly. i could've done witthout the sadly, but...

it's stupid, i know, but i can't shake this feeling that it was some kind of watershed moment. time will tell. (note, i'd like to think that it WAS a watershed moment)...

sometimes i think to myself that i'm a total fool -- inventing emotional crisis where there are none. but as i sit here in the many-shadowed light of the parking lot, feeling the tug of old feelings like the tide pulling at my legs, i think that i may just be waking up to who i am. calling myself a poet is a bit overwrought, but i *want* to put passion into whatever relationship i ultimately get into. i want to... blow her away. not because i want to be some kind of super romeo or somehting, but because the idea of blessing somebody like that... of 'turning on the brights' ... it's something that i desire so much. but the realist side of me keeps me remembering that everything isn't pretty and happy, thankfully.

work was interesting today -- we're going to be doing a full campaign and identity thing for a funeral home. Wheeeee! david said that he was planning on putting a big ol' dead body on a postcard and saying: "This could be you! Are you ready?" i suggested that we not do the brainstorming for that project on a friday afternoon, and he concurred...

nate had wonderful news:

natezilla:	We have new toys in the office.
Daimhin:	Ooooh!
Daimhin:	Tell, tell.

Daimhin:	Wait. So he gave you WEAPONS?
Daimhin:	This strikes me as a critical miscalculation.
natezilla:	Ya, well...
