i didn't stop grinning today, either.

worked on kirkby and associates, the keyboard for the office pc never showed up, so we've got an idiot-savant 486 sitting on my desk next to the iMac. over lunch, filled out a bizarre survey that erin burk sent around -- one of those wacky net.friend surveys. it wasn't really that wacky, truth be told, until i started answering it. sample question:

> Where do you see yourself in 10 years:
> Depending on how the world goes, I see myself working with a digital
> media/entertainment company... Hopefully creating virtual worlds for
> training, education, and entertainment. If that doesn't work out, I see
> myself roaming the war-ravaged ruins of North America in a souped-up Volvo
> with a harpoon gun bolted to the roof.

after work, i wrote up a brief rant, inspired by a friend who's changed her net handle to 'man-hater.'

> "Why aren't there any nice guys left in the world?"
> 
> "The only good men are married or gay."
> 
> "Men are pigs."
> 
> Everyone reading this has heard those comments -- or ones like them -- from
> the smug lips of a female at /some/ point. A good number of my close friends
> are females -- because of my personality, or perhaps the luck of the draw,
> you might say that my circle of confidantes and friends is a little light on
> the testosterone side. Over the years, I've listened as they were burned and
> bruised emotionally, then lashed out at the duller gender. Their failure to
> pick good boyfriends, obviously, was confirmation of the male sex's inherent
> evil.
> 
> Girls -- and I call you girls because 'women' implies maturity -- I have to
> break something to you.
> 
> There are some nasty guys out there, most definitely. Some have them have
> set their sights on people I cared for, and I don't look favorably on people
> who manipulate and use my friends. But for every jerk... every insensitive,
> womanizing guy... there's a bitchy, shrewish, manipulative female out there
> as well.
> 
> I spent years as The Nice Guy. A friend. I enjoy being a friend -- God knows
> it's safer than getting into a relationship with most girls. A guy would get
> shot down in seconds for making generalizations about women, branded as a
> misogynistic pig. But get three girlfriends together, and ten bucks says
> man-bashing will take center stage.
> 
> "Why are all the cute guys jerks?" One friend asked me.
> 
> "Oh," I replied, "there are ugly jerks, too."
> 
> In the end, it doesn't matter much to me -- there /are/ healthy,
> well-adjusted women out there. I'm lucky enough to know one of those
> healthy, mature women, and I love her like my own life. She sees my failures
> as my own, and others' failures as theirs. Confusing those two is a recipe
> for confusion and bitterness.
> 
> Man-haters of the world? Hear this; You've got a long, lonely road ahead of
> you. Judge each person on their own merits. When you get hurt, don't blame
> mankind. You're only hurting yourselves.


talked briefly to someone that i knew eons ago. bumped into them a week or so ago and talked briefly -- she begged me to make a char on resort and i declined, laughing it off. turns out that she just broke up with someone and was looking for SO material. she was as subtle as a brick, commenting that she would be moving to chicago soon and would be /soooo/ lonely. i told her i wasn't in the SO market but was, as always, a potential friend.

i guess i have to learn that there are people out there that don't want that. it's sad, i guess. like what douglas coupland wrote about in life after God -- people who are beyond our touch. people we just have to shake our heads and be sad for. and be scared by, sometimes.

every time i've logged on since then it's been hi-snuggle-nuzzle-kiss-howsyourday-wannatakeashowerwithme. just... inescapable. i finally asked her tonight, "so, do you just page me when you want to nuzzle someone?" i guess it wasn't the best way to say it. but i don't know what else i could've done. "I told you I could be a friend. That I'm not in the market as a potential SO. and I don't know how to respond when someone approaches me in that manner." she got angry, hissed and clawed metaphorically.

she doesn't even know me.

"i'm used to getting what i want," she said coyly, as if this should somehow be an alluring trait. i remembered the words alison said so long ago. "Your heart is beautiful, Jeff. That's what I appreciate about you most of all." so incredibly, amazingly different... I can't even wrap words around what that sentence did to me. it was like... all the things that i've wanted to build. those foundation-things that i figured no one would ever see, but would be important to have when the time came... someone saw those. someone saw the /me/ behind my eyes, just a glimpse of it... and /that/ is what she smiled at.

i hate missing her.

i hate knowing that minutes are ticking by until january.

i hate that she'll have no net access.

i care about her, God. and i miss her before she's even gone.
