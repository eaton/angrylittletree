oh, it's the ice.. age.. bay-bee, no mis-take about it... i've still got that song going through my head. work was weirded out today -- we were all plugging away on various projects and David was in and out, but everyone was feeling zoned and slightly loopy, as if the oxygen level had dropped a few percentage points. wheee!

tim's date with tiffany arbuckle (or a reasonable facsimile named brooke) commences sunday; in china*blue's words, in an office with three people and three kids, you work with what little gossip you've got. he's dating tiffbrookany, and carrying on a long distance relationship with his friend sarah. oi! oi vey!

we've determined that we MUST start doing web consulting, just so we can operate an office suck-o-meter every friday afternoon when we're getting loopy. "What is this? Who told them this was okay? Who?" The idea of getting paid to write up a proposal to someone is pretty appealing. With ten a month, we could actually make pretty good money...

got home, cnagged bacon and chowed down. talked to china*blue after a random question from her -- she's trying to figure out whether she's puritanical for having bad feelings about the group sex parties that her boyfriend's friends get together for. oi. welcome to the 90's... talked briefly about the issue of sex before marriage, and she hinted at a prior 'first relationship' that involved physical intimacy. of some sort.

drove to living water with massivivid blaring and my shades on; a good feeling on the open road. unfortunately, 53 was a bit less than open, and traffic doubled my transit time. my carefully allocated 'slack' time was chewed to nothing flat -- resulting in a smooth down-to-the-second entrance into the parking lot, with the engine chugging to a stop just as the clock flipped to 7:00 sharp.

Stan and Brian were there waiting and we headed back caravannishly to Chad and Jennifer's house with Becky in the lead. Introductions and shoe-removals followed, a suburbanized version of a Japanese tea ritual. We all camped in their living room and watched Christian Slater in Bed of Roses. Gah! He was definitely appealing in the role, and exuded the sort of sensitive vulnerability that makes women want to swoon. But sheesh! The guy was a stalker! He was nuts. ;)

And, above and beyond, he was way too into the rescuer vibe; Dr. Laura would have him for lunch. After the movie we played cards on the living room coffee table -- chad's first move was an ill-fated attempt to teach me euchre. we quickly moved to hearts, where becky received the brunt of the points. bwaha! thank you, marie, for teaching me hearts on mplayer! by the end of the evening becky was shooting me evil looks across the table and tossing cards at me like shuriken. teehee!

after we all watched some leno and looked disgusted (he's getting cruder and lewder every time i see him, sigh), brian and stan and i headed out to denny's for a late night snack. "Geeze," brian laughed when stan went to the restroom. "He know,s like, /everybody/." when we walked in, three people in dennys called out to him; as we sat down two passers by greeted him. hey, stan! dude! and so on. it was comical!
