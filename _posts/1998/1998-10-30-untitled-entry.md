zoiks, scoob! what was that?

i dunno. there's still lingering strangeness about my feelings, but the freakishly intense emotional splat from last night has passed. perhaps some of it came from my odd moods following the long drive home in the dark rain listening to depressing synthpop love songs.

anyhow. today went well, accomplished good work on the kirkby site. david was away doing the meeting thing for a good part of the day, and after the totals were drawn, we had lots of new work lined up at the door with additional stuff coming around the curve. must. finish. kirkby. kirkby. must. di-- er. never mind...

talked to alison more. listened to "The Screaming Tree" and a new mp3 by Anything Box. luv luv luvvvv. an article in the economist about MP3's and the issues raised by the growth of digital distribution made my thoughts jump to streamers and my concepts for 'shades. so i sent out spammy mail to a bunch of people i know and asked them what they thought about the issue. will video ultimately face the same problems? will homebrew sitcoms and films and plays threaten hollywood? who knows...

mike has offered to host my address book of people-who-wanna-be-spammed as a genuine majordomo, which would be cool. i just have to decide... what will I *name* it? augh!

alison is arriving tomorrow at 1ish 2ish after i check out a geo prizm. she suggested she could wear "her full length black velvet dress" to the savior machine show. i think my appearance would plummet to sub-chopped-liver status. *smile*

i'm redubbing the mix tape as i go to bed. we'll see how it turns out in the morning. ni ni.
