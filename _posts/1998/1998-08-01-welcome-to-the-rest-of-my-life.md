Went to Borders' tonight and browsed around for an extended period of time. Flirted with the idea of getting two interesting looking books, and a scifi anthology or two, but caution prevailed and I walked home bookless.

One of the most frustrating experiences in life is going to a bookstore, looking around, and leaving empty handed. It's like flirting with somebody at a party for three hours, then driving home without bothering to ask for their number.

The only reason it happens, really, is fear. You know what I'm talking about. "Gee... This one's kind of interesting. I like the premise, and the first couple pages looked cool. Nice dialogue... slick cover art!" But then you realize there's a big looming twenty-two-ninety-five slapped on the cover, and wham. Commitment!

Will I get home and sit down to read and realize that it fizzles after the first couple chapters? Or maybe it's annoying and lecture-y. Or maybe it's secretly a heinlein book! It's like wondering if asking for the number is going to be some kind of commitment to call. Or 'get to know them better' if the urge to keep in contact vanishes.

This is why I hang around the bargain book rack. If I find something interesting, it's no problem. Scrape a couple bucks together and enjoy. If you really like it, well, hey, you just put it in a cool place on the shelf and that's that. It's kind of like getting to know the girl who's not afraid to give her number to you without you asking. You can say, 'Oh, sure, that's cool,' and swap digits without having to justify the act with follow-up.

Plonk.

In moments of clarity, I have to admit to myself that I'm obsessed with relationships. In lieu of having one, i rant about them.

Last night we headed over to Danny's house in Aurora and hung around, listened to music, watched the first half of Star Trek: First Contact, and other assorted activities. Sang old Petra songs with Danny and laughed hard, made fun of the Borg queen. ("How can you possibly be attracted to someone whose wriggling metalic spine you just saw lowered into a gooey prosthetic body?" "But Jeff, she's /ripped/!") Other jokes included the two borg wandering into a holodeck simulation of a 1930s jazz club, with everyone dancing. They wandered through, looking confused, and I had a sudden vision of the boarg trying to 'blend in' by dancing together through the crowd with awkward, jerky movements. I mentioned it to Danny. "Captain! They've adapted!" We all laughed.

It being the first day of the first month of my almost legal fully-adult life, it seems kind of fitting to start seriously diary writing again. I hate the fact that I slip out of this -- there's so much that I want to remember, so many egocentric rants that I want to record! Er, wait, that's not quite right... In any case, I know there are things I've forgotten that I'll never be able to capture the original flavor of again.

Driving to the plumb concert with Ben and Becky, getting lost on the way and seeing it and loving it and then playing six degrees of kevin bacon on the way back. singing all of 'this means war' and 'kenniniah of the levites' in a steak n'shake in rural indiana with danny. Or darker things, like regret about relationships and intimacy. I suppose, on thinking about it, that that's something I'd rather not capture the original feel of.

Come to think of it... that's one of the times that I let my diary writing trail off. Not a shock. If I can't be honest with my diary, who can I be honest with? Well.. God, but that's another matter. I wasn't willing to externalize anything. Not even in the safe digital world of BBEdit and PGP.

Other things have happened, though, thankfully better ones.

Of late, there's been a bit of frustration over the whole thing with Dawn and Jason. I mean, not necessarily good 'Hmm, I'm concerned for my friend" frustration. If I'm honest, it's jealousy. Which probably is an indication of the negative state of things internally. In me, that is. It's weird though. I mean, they're joined at the hip completely. Giving each other little looks all the time, touching, squeezing not like, anything major. just total low level contact. i really could've gone without learning that jason smells really good, or the jason's bellybutton is cute, or that jason's ears are shaped soooooooooo cute, etc... if that makes any sense.

it repulses me but at the same time i envy it. i want to be cynical and stereotypically droll. but i can't, not in my heart, and still be honest. long long ago i write that i was considering becoming a charicature of myself. my own 'cinematic equivalent.' the only problem, i think, is that the plot never quite works out. like arnold's character in 'last action hero,' a cinematic character trapped in the real world will always be a fish out of water. there's no over-riding narrative to carry it to climax and completion, at least inside of an acceptable timeframe.

perhaps that's why i write these little stories of my life and the lives of my friends. trying to conjour up narrative structure from the chaos of everyday life. give direction and dramatic pacing to the confusion of normalcy. turn 'fun' into 'vingettes' and preserve them forever, like a great episode of 'mad about you.'

it is true... i'm a repressed director.

sigh.
