visited howard concrete at work today, was very cool. plowed through vast majority of the C9 site, and am very pleased with the results as is david. found a great new place to get office space -- indowntown wheaton above tate's ice cream shop -- and i finished reading 'hyperion.' more to follow on that. I wanna know about the Shrike, darnit!

rode my bike, wondering if i'll miss it when i get a car.
