hurch. woomph! startlingly, elisa dimonda showed up for the service and we spent a litte time catching up. i discovered that she knows christy simpson, and some laughing and blinking followed. it turns out that they knew each other back when elisa was "a little twelve year old nerd!" must learn more. muahaha.

slight strangeness in sunday school as becky poked and attempted to poke-tickle me as she wandered by. the gesture was repeated a few other times, and over the course of the day, it combined with random compliments. it took me four hours to blink, turn around, and blink s'more. "was she FLIRTING with me?" laws of the universe dictate that the answer is no, obviously, but still.

the complication that immediately arises... is the fact that Stan is sweet on her in an impressively complete fashion. sigh. in Hikaru's words, "Damn! The angst rubs off to /real/ life for you, boy!"

the evening christmas party was a lot of fun -- FRIED CHICKEN! AW YEEAH! -- but I was foolish enough to ride with the family instead of taking Jaws. end result? I was twenty minutes late and ended up jammed into a corner for the two hours of the party. the church was /packed/ and i never saw stan, bri, or the rest of the gang until we were all filing out and leaving.

still, the fried chicken... happysigh.
