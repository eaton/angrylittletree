friday i headed into work, chugged through things in a semi-haze. I got stuff hammered down but David Davoust wasn't in the office and it was hard to connect. He showed up briefly during lunch and then was off to a motel in Michigan to meet the wife and kids.

I'd made the reservations for him earlier -- a woman with a vaguely scandinavian voice made liberal use of the words, "Yah, dontchaknow" as she took down the credit card information.

it was spitting rain all day, and the ride back and forth to and from work was slightly damp. Not too bad, really -- but enough to make me press myself to get home before it decided to worsen.

After work, hitched a ride with Dad over to Jason's with the plan of spending the night. Jason and Beck were there as well, playing some sort of 70's groove-funk thing on two guitars and the drum machine. We mingled, went out and grabbed food at Wendy's, and other assorted stuff.

Came home and did things that i can't remember -- Lynelle had arrived when we got back, and we talked. she's messed. really spooked -- her job has been going 'well' but it's a mafia resturant. the friend of the manager got busted by the FBI a month ago or something... scary crap like that. three funerals in the family in two months or something.

the best friend of the boyfriend of the daughter of the owner is hot for lynelle; the owner's daughter tried to fix them up and he was all over her at dinner. now she's trying to figure out how to tell this huge full-blooded italian to drop dead. and the vibes at work are not at all good.

she wandered off late, though, rather than stay aroudn to watch anything. i hung with jason and ben, and we griped after missing hollywood video's closing time by minutes; we'd hoped to rent ladyhawke. consciousness late.

and woke up late, saturday morning. Read primary colors and enjoyed it; Jason was asleep late, and Dawn's doorbell woke him up; he was supposed to drive her to work and she had to walk over to the house.

it all blurred, really -- we went out and got stuff to eat. subs, as chance would have it. in the evening everyone including Danny and Deacon made their way over and we had a movie fest. Dr. Who, Pretty in Pink, Aliens, Veggie Tales, and Conspiracy Theory. Played Charades, too -- Jason had to act out stuff like 'Skunk sniffing a porcupine with the measles,' and 'a very special episode of family ties.'
