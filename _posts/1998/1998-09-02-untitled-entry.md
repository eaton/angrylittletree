random observation of the day: getting a blow-pop stuck in your beard is one of the most annoying experiences in the known universe, right behind 'help, i'm locked in a closet with gilbert gotfreid.'


I'm working, again, on my ultimate love song compilation. based on an idle comment from Tero, I decided to have side A be love songs and Side B be jilted love songs. the mix, currently, goes something like this:

Side 1 : Love At First Loop
--
Kiss Me (Sixpence None The Richer)
In Your Eyes (Peter Gabriel)
Our Restless Hearts (Mark Heard)
About Love (The Choir)
Love Songs (Fleming and John)
Sugar Rush/I'm Your Boy (Joy Electric)
Bendy Line (The Prayer Chain)

Side 2 : The Angst Mix
--
She Walks in Beauty (The Black Peppercorns)
Unloved by Aleixa (Joey B's 'The Chicks Will Dig It' remix)
Velour Shirt (Hokus Pick Maneurver)
Candy Cane Carriage (Joy Electric)
If Ever Maria (Mortal, Lusis)
How We Shipwrecked Our Lives (Britannika)
Coffee With Caffeine (Kevin Clay)

i like it. somee very very fun stuff, and worthy of some repeat play. now if only i can find some ska songs to even out the mix and perhaps replace 'if ever maria'...

tonight after work, mirage on TCZ talked to me and seemingly randomly started opening up about how she felt... how she didn't feel. "I'm just sort of rambling .. I'm not sure how I feel anymore.. or what my life is supposed to be about .. I want to be a part of something, something big .. something that means something to me, but I never fully commit .. like it's never really good enough or big enough or quite what I was looking to be involved in... It wasn't a conscious change though, it was more of a gradual hardening of the soul..."

I wrote to alison, and found myself wishing that i had a car so that i could trek out to that coffeehouse she was talking about. the idea of that road trip seemed so appealing to me. still does seem very appealing. Me, my music -- a tape recorder... and the miles rolling away under me.

And admittedly, seeing Allison.

I'm so /confused/. About attraction. Love. Infatuation. Whatever it is, whatever anything is. I find myself thinking of Alison fondly, and then remembering that three weeks ago i was in the throes of a heated crush on Kristin. I never thought I'd ever in my life be attracted to two people at once. I was sure that no one would be attracted to me; at least, no one that I would be able to pursue a relationship with.

perhaps that was just my 'savor the angst' side talking, keeping those thoughts in the forefront. *sigh* It's easy to say that telling someone your feelings for them is cool when they're the only one. But if you're attracted to two people, then it becomes infinitely more complex.

the possibility of hurting someone else increases exponentially... and when it gets down to it, that's what i fear far more than being hurt myself. I wish it all made more sense; life, other people, me... I have a job but no future with it, thanks to the Kansas changes that are coming. I have a complete blank slate there in Kansas... and when  I'm alone, I can /do/ that... I just...

I don't know. I feel like... I'm not confident enough of me and you, of my hearing God's voice and guidance, to risk screwing someone else up along the way. I'm reminded of Flannery O'Connor's words, "IT's harder to believe than not to." It is. With knowledge comes responsability. I wish I could just throw my backpack over my shoulder and hike off into the distance, facing the unknown and relishing the feel of the wind on my face.

but i can't have my cake and eat it, too.

i suppose if i read this later, i'll have no idea what I meant. I suppose the conflict broiling in me, at the moment at least, is twofold.

One, how can I hope ot have a relationship when I am 'attracted' to two people? perhaps the answer is, 'you don't.' I wish I knew for sure; I could live with it. the other is... he thought that i could not ask someone i loved, cared for... to join me in a life where i have no way to provide for them. if i did.. what would i be? i wouldn't really be caring for them. the thought of it /hurts/. i can feel it in my chest, a needling that runs from my pectorals to my shoulders in a cold wave.
