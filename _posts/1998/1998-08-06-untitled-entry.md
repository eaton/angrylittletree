ten days til i'm the big two-one. it's late, and i'll make a cursory entry. *sigh* kristin is reading the celestine prophecy... and it's moving, or something like that. i wish i could just urn off my emotions... dig out my heart and leave it in a closet somewhere, where it wouldn't interfere. *sigh*

i don't know. i realize that i want to craft events into a narrative sometimes ... like a screenwriter turning everyday stuff into the wheat of a story. but it doesn't happen that way; people's lives are people's lives.

in other news i have been reading more about scientology. it's mind-blowing. according to www.lronhubbardbio.org, he's one of the world's most accomplished musicians in a variety of styles, a world-famous singer, the father of modern science fiction, a naval hero, the man who's had the most profound impact on literature in recent memory... the greatest film-maker ever told.. a matchless humanitarian and philanthropist... it just goes on and on. it's like... Wow! Buackaroo Banzai lives!

will be meeting up with Tammy on Sunday and Monday, hopefully; she'll be in town. the whole thing with Kristin still weighs on me. I suppose. I was so fucking STUPID... *sigh* Sorry, God. :/

guess i'll rant more about it later. night.
