interesting day, this one! what updates? hmm. well, we're getting hooked onto a T1 from the office two doors down, for $150 a month no less. The-List dissolved into bad vibes when Michael reposted private mail to it during a snippy exchange about feminism -- the list's first unsubscribe request was received.

chugging through mirrorshades. working on logo ideas for Stoplight Coffee. Etc etc. Heard from Alison via ICQ, and she asked if it would work out for her to arrive friday (!) and leave sunday (!). after discussion it seemed that it wouldn't work out well.

the dynamic between Alison and it is... odd. sigh.
