yay, yay, yay. the imac was still there. it wasn't a dream!

listening to massivivid at my desk right now; tim had the new full length CD at work and we oooohed and aaaahed over it and dave -- poor, music-swamped dave -- endured for two and a half tracks. 

at one point during the day i started humming 'it's my party and i'll cry if i want to;' dave groaned at me. "Thanks a /lot/, Jeff! Now we'll be trying to get that out of our heads for the rest of the day." He retaliated by singing the first few verses of The Song That Never Ends. I laughed and explained that i'm immune to such attacks, thanks to my mother's habit of humming catchy tunes and singing the brownie song. i've been totally desensitized!

for the rest of the day, though, tim would occasionally start humming the song, then growl in frustation and hit his head. "Make it stooop..." Dave finally apologized. "I'm sorry, Tim. I was aiming for Jeff, and you were collateral damage."

talked to alison yet more. and more. i don't know what to /say/. last night i asked steph how one kindly says, "i think you're attracted to me and i'm attracted to you, but i'm trying unsuccessfully to kick a year-old crush, and i don't feel it would be fair to you to get into a relationship with that complication hanging there." she said, 'just like that.'

i am out of fiction to read; i can feel my palms going clammy.

encouraging news from c9 construction: a kinko's called them and wanted them to bid on the job to remodel the interior of the store. i would be a MASSIVE job for them, a big windfall; when asked how they found out about c9, the manager replied simply. 'Oh. I was looking around on the net and I saw your web site...' He SHOOTS! he SCORES!
