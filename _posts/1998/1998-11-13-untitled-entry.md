definitely an interesting day as they go. as danny said while we circled the parking lot of mcdonalds on 59 for the fourth time, trying to figure out whether naperville was to the right or the left, "When we all die and spend eternity in heaven, we're gonna be watching this video for a loooooooong time. And when God says, 'oooh, heheh, I love that part! Hold on, let's to rewind it and see that part again! Hahahah...' We'll HAVE to watch, because He has the remote." deacon and i laughed our heads off and danny smirked quietly.

but it was good, because at least we had the car again.

i should back up and give the pretext.

good half day of work, polishing a little more of the hydro-flow manual and working out some additional issues with the proxy server. drove some stuff to the new office when david called, and then swung by the license department to get my new drivers license. huzzah, i'm legal and everything! i'm still bewildered, though, by the fact that it took 30 minutes to process four people's license renewals when there were 3 people working there. I mean... does this strike anyone ELSE as massive inefficiency? in any case, when the still-hot laminated plastic hit my grubby little fingers, i was staring at a much friendlier photo of myself. it's one i can live with for four years.

The rest of the day was spent loading the back of the corolla with boxed computer gear, driving to and from the downtown office, and listening to ani difranco songs while drumming the steering wheel at stoplights.

around 6PM i realized i should eat lunch. banged over to the library, checked out the '62 to '66 beatles anthology and a collection of cuban mambo music, and sat in the parking lot with the lights of my car off, scarfing a PBJ sandwich while they sang "Love Me Do."

got home, ate macaroni and beef, and headed for danny's house to pick up the double d's; 80's synthpop night on 92.8FM, and i was in hog heaven. cleared a pile of TCP/IP and networking ref manuals from the front seat for deacon, stuck danny's bass in the trunk, and we all cruised.

in retrospect, stopping at the shell station to make change for tolls was a bad idea. more specifically, locking the doors of the toyota WHEN we shopped at the shell station was a bad idea. with the keys inside. in the ignition. with the engine running.

we got back to the car and i started searching my pockets. then circling the car. after a couple of minutes we realized that there was no hope of another door appearing in the body somewhere, and just stared thoughtfully.

"This," deacon opined, "Is when we need KITT. a Smart car."
"Or maybe smart /drivers/?"
"Shaddup, Danny."

much laughing. shaking of heads. rubbing of faces. when something like that happens in the bad section of aurora, it just pegs out the surreal-o-meter. a block or two away the police were pulling over a carful of people. maybe a getaway from a liquor store heist or something.

"Fortunately, I just got my keys duped last night."
"And do you have them /with/ you, Jeff."
"Not in a literal sense..."

Called home, Dad was out, and we laughed again at the growing surrealness of it. God, Danny decided, needed some entertainment tonight... Deacon shrugged and grinned a canary-eating grin. "Well, /I/ didn't have anything planned for tonight."

So we spent an hour or so wandering the parking lot, browsing the shell station, leaning against the car, peering at the payphone, staring down the road, playing crazy eights with deacon's pack of cards on the sidewalk, wondering if various thuggy looking customers would pull out sawed-offs and demand fistfulls of cash, and making lots of wry jokes.

"Paulie. Very good movie," said Deacon at one point, breaking silence.
"Paulie?"
"Yeah, Paulie. The movie with the--"
"Talking parrot?" danny interrupted.
"Yeah, that one. Very good movie."
I boggled.
"Well, it has some good dialog! It's very funny."
"of course it's funny," i said. "they don't cast parrots in dramatic roles."
in the background, danny slid off the car laughing.
"Well, Jerry McGuire..."
I frowned. "Wait... you mean the parrot could've been in Jerrie McGuire?"
"Well, no. One of the actors from it did Paulie's /voice/."
"OOoooh." I grinned. "okay, I was /thinking/..."
"Well, then again, I'm sure that if Tom Cruise can do it..." Deacon's voice trailed off.
Danny returned to the conversation. "Exactly!"

a group of gangish looking individuals had collected aroudn the payphone and didn't look like they were ready to share it.

A longer pause as we leaned against the car and watched traffic. "So, who /else/ feels like they're trapped in an episode of sienfield right now?"
"Jeff," said deacon, "I've felt that way for a couple of years now."

deacon went in to buy pork rinds after determining that beck would be elaine. danny, being a vegetarian, quietly and kindly informed deacon that he would stomp on the pork rinds if deacon put them in his face once more. he was smiling, though, so deacon did. danny took them, set them on the sidewalk, and methodically stomped them to pork rind powder, then offered the bag back with a slight bow. I turned and blinked and stared -- i was in the middle of trying to place a collect call home and looked at the two of them. 

"well," said deacon. "i think the stress relief for danny was worth it."

(i would've had to go in and buy more 5 cent bubblegum to get more change. i'd already beeen chewing on it from the LAST call.)

we sat on the sidewalk and played crazy eights while we waited for the volvo to show up. we started critiquing passing cars on their volvoness or lack thereof.

"I'm sensing a distinc lack of volvoness in our vicinity," danny said.
"indeed."

finally, he arrived and we got the key from him and all was well. we wandered around aurora fruitlessly looking for the path to jason's, as if it would be marked with bread crumbs, and finally lost dad as we got near '59. which is where we got disoriented and spent some time circling, doubleing back, u-turning, and generally wandering aimlessly in a one square mile area near a mcdonalds parking lot.

eventually, though, we found 75th, and naperville, and the hollywood video, and jason's house. jackie chan was excellent and john cussack was misfiled under comedy. ("You know, we should have suspected that 'Money for nothing' wasn't a comedy when we found ISHTAR in the comedy section...") all was well, though, 'cause it ended well.
