many things happened today and i know i'll forget some of them before i get them written down -- it's the nature of it, i suppose. worked on CTS stuff and Howard Concrete web design -- in desperate need of photos for that site. Gah!

talked to tim, the guy who may be joining us at robis -- spooooky. i asked what he did at cstone, and we discovered further cross-overs.

"Oh, i wanted to catch a concert by some friends of mine who just got signed..."
"Oh? what group?"
"Massivivid."
"Wally and Sherri!"
Long pause.
"Oh, man..."

Come to find out he was one of the organizers of that rave that the shaws were part of a while back that i missed. what amazingly, freakishly spooky coincidences. anyhow, i talked to him and it was cool -- i'd really like to work with him.

in other interesting news, the first publicized cybernetic implant took place this week. a researcher had a 30x3mm glass tube implanted in his arm, containing a chip and a transmitter. his computer can tell when he walks into rooms, and notify him of his mail automatically.

welcome to the future.

i'm just interested in seeing what will happen if we combine prosthetics research with that -- you know, tie a transmitter into basic nerve impulses. train people with biofeedback, and then have 'em control home electronics with it. wild stuff.

actually, that's an interesting thought. initial research in cybernetic implants might not be /neural/ implants... just pathces into little-used nerves, then training people in biofeedback to give the implant pulses. it's something i'll have to remember for my stories. cool.
