random notes about the previous night. 

[EvilGlee] Hikaru just grins. I hate to say it, but you two are gonna fall head over heels in love. That's my prediction. Either that, or the moment will pass, and you two will be the best friends in the whole friggin' world. I prefer the former. ;)

i prefer either.

mom liked her; she said that she liked hearing her laugh -- that alison was 'a real person. someone that you can be normal and relax around. she's cuter than her pictures.'

went to church, was present at church, drove home from church. mail from alison -- yay yay. she liked the beginning of my story, which i must now write more on. so far i've figured out that the protagonist and his wife are down and out former hardcore netheads. they dropped out of the scene; psychological problems associated with their work. now they don't net directly in any way. it's all secondhand; occasionally they see a little TV or movies or what not, but everything else they get printed hardcopy and read it over. with their hands and eyes and the whole deal.  they're going to start seeing imcreasing signs of the 'realness' of their dreams and start trying to run. she will go back into the net to try to stop the inteligence, and be killed or trapped or suspended or absorbed.

emote rambles. sorry!

alison told me, 'you apologize too much, jeff... i had a beautiful, wonderful, amazing fun time.' after further conversation, i was about to head out and she asked, 'hmmmmm. did i really kiss your ear?'

i told her i'd have to ask it when it was awake.

"i'm glad i can match your smile to your words tonight," i told her, and she :smiled. "me, too."

but that was last night; no matter. um. yeah. i drove over to jason's to hang with the gang and we did varied hangie-outtie things. finally piled into the volvo and listened to mukala as i drove danny and deacon home. jason and dawn snuggled in the back seat on the way home and i reprimanded him for unsafe passenger practices. "You know, I could brake suddenly and you'd be kissing mister windshield."

brief discussion of relationship angst. i related some of the details of the alison visit to jason, in private after we got back to the house, and he nodded sagely. "I wish I could give you advice," he said sheepishly. "but I guess... when i was in kind of a similar situation i just did the stupid thing." he smiled. "i can listen, though..."

dove home, listening to the vanjellis blade runner soundtrack, and felt supernatural. i was in the dark, ethereal music wafting around me in the confines of my swedish box on wheels... the road sweeping by under the tires. you know the feeling, i'm sure.

talked to nate and tammy online; sigh. nate is angsting slightly and we commiscerated pleasantly, as always. he made a startling confession... he hasn't enjoyed programming for years. "I don't enjoy work when that's the only thing around to take any enjoyment in.  Then it's just imprisonment and slavery to a task." never thought i'd hear that from nate, to be honest... but when i think about it, it makes sense. he's demonstrated a notable lack of interest in techish stuff for quite a while. i always chalked it up to 'jaded geek chic' but... weariness seems to fit the bill.

i almost fell asleep at jason's, sprawled on the downstairs couch. a firm pillow rested against my shoulder, and for a few moments, i closed my eyes and imagined it was alison's shoulder. pathetic. ;;for(10);$angst_utils:slap(self);

oh. i was laughing and asked the gang who i revved the engine at the other night in the park. they all stared blankly at me. "Wait a minute. you mean... there was... you were all at the house by then?" I laughed hard for a few minutes. "Wow. I must've scared the heck out of /some/ couple in the park...
