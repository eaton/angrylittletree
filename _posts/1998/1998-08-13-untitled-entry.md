soundtrack for the day: U2's Joshua Tree, Prayer Chain's Pray Naked. Took a bunch of ORieley books over to David Davoust, which thrilled him to say the least. talked with China*Blue over lunch and afer work about relatiosnhips and stuff -- she's been going through some stuff, but it's leveling out. *sigh* still praying for her and her SO. It hurts to think about the stuff that he's struggling with and she is vicariously working through.

She asked how things were going with me, and pried a bit about the kristin thing. Asked why I wasn't wooing her. After attempting to explain, i mentioned that my mind had made up the best course, but my heart was not always cooperating. she noted that most guys leave the deciding up to less appropriate parts of the anatomy... that mentioning the heart was, in and of itself, something to be admired. i guess that was comforting. *laugh*

I started work on my top ten list. Without further ado...

The Care And Feeding Of Your Crush On A Platonic Friend:

1. Avoid abstract discussions about relationships, love, or related subjects. In fact, avoid discussing the future, the past, or the present. Weather is permissible as long as you don't see her face in cloud formations.

2. Never, ever, ever joke about being attracted to them or being in a relationship with them. If they do something cool, "Marry me!" isn't a joke -- it's a do-it-yourself tracheotomy.

3. If the object of your affliction -- er, affection is currently dating someone else, never, ever, ever get sucked into discussions of the SO's failings. Or strengths. Or proper name.

4. Three words: Double Entendres Kill.

damn. DAMN! had a deep conversation with her... DAMN!
