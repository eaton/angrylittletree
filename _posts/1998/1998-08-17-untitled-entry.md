there's a different smell to cards from females. not a perfumey smell, necessarily -- that's something external. maybe it's the way they keep their rooms or the kind of stuff they jam into their backpacks or whatever. I just smelled the birthday card I got from Erin Burke; sort of faint faint tinges of scented candles.

kristin's box, from long ago in the recesses of my mind, had a much stronger, but similar difference to it. sunflowers like nobody's business.

work was weirdly mild today, with david and his family gone all day, stuck in traffic getting back from their vacation. i got a nice design (I think) whipped up on the crosswinds logo, and read a little of Rainbow Six on lunchour, after finishing up a letter to Alison. which is a complex issue that should be addressed fully in short order.

Clinton went on the air today, as many people expected, and addressed the nation, admitting that he misled everyone ... including his wife. people in #christian and #bible were in a feeding frenzy. it was sad... watching it. after reading primary colors it was so... so... strange. the pain, i was thinking... of his family, hillary, chelsea. 

and all that we can do is bicker about whether he said 'misled' or 'lied', and rub our hands gleefully. either over his poltical fall or the titilating circus that surrounds it all.

peeked in on Phoenix.

[Public] Ardren ohs.  Well, how about for the computer illiterate who only
 word processers, uses navigator, and MUD programs?
[Public] Quinn: Um, Well.. personally?  I'd go for more CPU power... think
 iMac, maybe?
[Public] Quinn: I can't beleive I just said that.

[Public] Jason gasps!
[Public] Clone_Guest: Take me now, Jesus, I'm ready.
[Public] Clone_Guest looks up into the sky.
[Public] Brooke /cackles/.
[Public] Jason [to Quinn]: I knew it.  There /is/ good inside of you.

Vic's car got busted....

From afar, Tor has a feeling these guys were Radio-Theft Idiot Savants.  They
 did a brilliant job with the radio.  I mean /zero/ damage.  But they also
 took some dumb stuff, left a calling card (I'm sure), and left the jackets.
 *shrug*

thought for the night:

"Imagine every molecule in your body... taking separate vacations."
