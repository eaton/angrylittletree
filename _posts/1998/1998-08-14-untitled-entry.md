t-48 hours to B-day.

I suppose that the last line of my entry for yesterday needs some explaination. But I'll get along with the meat of the day before dealing with intangible unpleasantries.

got in, started cranking on scanning some stuff, and tinkered with mp files for the hydro-flow box. got that working, much  to david's delight, and worked on howard concrete's site as well. ddi some logo work for kirkby & assoc, and learned that dad talked to two of his bosses about the buy-out deal. blink blink.

news from kansas: in a freakist life imitates art move, someone has been buying up all the wheat. there's simply no 'stockpile' of wheat to purchase from, and none of the places are willing to tell who they sold it to. cripes! that stuff is supposed to happen in bad movies, not the midwest. we'll see how it turns out.

last night's conversation with kristin touched on that. i was... freaking, perhaps. and she... well, tried t help me, same thing i would've done if she were the one freaking over something like that.

Gaff Girl:	How do you know that it won't be better?  How can you try to convince me to have faith when you're not showing much now?

i blinked and couldn't answer for minutes. i mumbled something and afk'd, and it was resolved. but later (DAMN you, jeff!) I blurted out a half-confession, bitten back spurt of honest.

Daimhin:	at cornerstone one night around 3am as i was walking along by the light of the tiki torches and blending in with the crowds on the paths i decided, perhaps rashly, that if i could konw that you would be happy for the rest of your life and for eternity beyond that, know that you could be fulfilled and be touched by His love, not just rules or whatever... i decided that it would be worth giving up the hope of ever having a 'relationship' with anyone. a trade, i guess.
it's stupid i guess... like a kid promising God he'll eat broccoli for the rest of his life... but when you said that, about me not showing much faith... i don't know. it smacked me. it hit me the other way. i wondered if the way i deal with these things. the way i fear, or react, or whatever... i don't know. 

Gaff Girl:	*hugs*  I'm sorry.

Daimhin:	nah, it's okay... I mean, it wasn't what you said.

wanted to hit myself; all the carefully painstakingly metered hours of frivolity and non-deepness were totally BLOWN away in that very moment. The distance and aloofness and blase feeling I was trying to cultivate just got shot to hell and back, then bounced and burst into flames. And was subsequently run over by a marching band.

went out to see 'the avengers' with tam and her cousin from germany (a fan of kung foo movies and manga). a little trouble communicating with him, but it was still fun. at one point, cool as ice was mentioned and tammy made a comment about it being a movie with vanilla ice. he gave her a disbelieving look and said, with a slightly incredulous uncertain voice, 'as an actor?!'  priceless quote.

the avengers was good -- an utterly choreographed and polished big-budget flick that did nothing to stimulate the mind but drew a lot of over-the-top-gag laughter. british sensibility taken to perfect extreme, and uma thurman as a quite fetching scientist with a thing for thigh-high leather boots and red bodysocks. sneed, the ever-proper british secret agent, has an umbrella with a pop-out fencing sword. i want one! woo woo!

kristin's last comment last night left me sleepless...

Daimhin:	God loves you a lot. Even if I lose faith sometimes. *smile*
Gaff Girl:	I know. :0
Daimhin:	fortunately He's a lot more reliable than your average pasty geek.
Daimhin:	:-j
Gaff Girl:	The coincidence of that cross was too much to dismiss. ;)
Daimhin:	*laughing* you think?
Gaff Girl:	Yeah, probably. ;)
Daimhin:	I'm out cold. *hugs*
Daimhin:	bless you.

i don't know how to think anymore.
