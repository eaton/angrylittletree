it's te evening of the twentyfourth, and i'm about to go out and meander aroudn downtown wheaton with a tape recorder and a couple bucks. but i wanted to get some of this stuff down, at least. i spent the morning working side by side with tim, or working in parallel more accurately. worked yet more on the glossary stuff, then david got back from the networking/chamber meeting. we all fell into a rythm of work for an hour or two; he and tim were going ot see the office over lunch while i went to the dentist. huzzah!

before the family headed out i talked to tragedy briefly. then off to the dentist! i plowed through more and more of girlfriend in a coma along the way; it's a seductively rich book. spent more time in the waiting room charging through it, then was called in for the traditional cleaning regimen.

nothing like staring into a bright light and having someone's rubberized hands shoverd into your mouth for fifteen minutes or so to give you quality thinking time; i pondered the whole thing with alison.

dr. sacrey's daughter, a startlingly female dentist, was filling in for the elder toothman, and declared my teeth to be fit. i went back to my copy of girlfriend in a coma and was dead to the world for another several hours. douglas coupland is a great storyteller; no, not a storyteller. he is a great feel-teller. his stories are less 'literary'... but they surround, they /carry/ an intensely powerful vibe. a feel, an emotion and a meme. he wraps words around it, tightening them to hug its shape as best he can.

went home, and i slid into work at close-to-five to get a little last minute stuff done. dave and tim had visited the office and tim pulled me aside to boggle about the condition of the office. "He just /left/ everything there!" we shared a laugh about it and wondered what could've been up. david pulled off a startlingly impressive 'godfather' impersonation.

as work wound down lisa brought down popcorn and soda for us all; most definitely a friendly working environment. she and david considered going to autumnfest but david only wanted to see te free stuff. "It's so /expensive/ any more, it's not even worth it to go on the rides."

"Oh, yeah, dave, right. /you're/ going to drive by the ferris wheel with the kids in the car? how are you going to manage that?"

long silence.

i looked up from my copy of clarisworks. "Sedatives." and looked back down to type. moments laughter laughter followed. "I know, I know, it shows I'm not a parent," I admitted.

"Well," dave and lisa allowed in stereo. "Actually...."

dave kicked me out at six when i tried to explain how to make a phaser out of common household parts, and i booked home. ideas rolled aroudn for stories and i was near desperate to get something down on paper/screen for 'life after god' and wanted to hook up with jason, too.

i spent the evening trying to contact him, fruitlessly, and after a quick trip to the grocery store returned and made a final call -- contact! danny, deacon, jason and jake were going to be meeting at danny's place to watch spinal tap and other stuff like that. they would come over and pick me up on the way. i smiled. it was looking good.

stopped in (swearing the last time) to see tragedyalison. we chatted for a little while, and out of the blue she asked if i would be interested in having company saturday. 15 minutes later we were trying to work out the details of a trip there; i felt so... so ODD about it. but swing music, autumn fest, ferris wheels... the idea was appealing in the extreme. but i had no idea how i would get back from danny's in time.

i gnashed and flailed but couldn't work it out... or perhaps was afraid to try too hard to work it out. before logging on i got email from her; just wanting to let me know that I was loved and thought of. "by me. in only the best way." i wanted to see her but was scared that the step would carry the weight of ... inevitability? expectations?

in only a few minutes i tried to thrash through all those things, typing back and forth with potential times and changing plans and a hundred other things, time ticking away as i waited for danny and deacon and jason to arrive. they did; alison had to leave. she seemed disappointed, understandably in an objective sense. i went with the gang, a cloud over my head for the rest of the evening -- i growled out loud at deacon as we entered the car, and the situation (in brief) was explained.

the evening proper turned out to be... anticlimactic in some ways, enjoyable in others. i booted mel with the external keyboard and deacon did a comic quintuple-take, jaw hanging. danny laughed his head off. jake and jason tried to create a hilariously funny mock radio show for beck and only succeeded in being stupid and juvenile. in retrospect i wonder if jason is trying to hide from the world 'out there' -- trying desperately to cling to the safe, fun-meaningless world of goofing around with friends and making jokes about feces and urine.

danny and i trudged upstairs; i tried to write a letter to alison but ran aground explaining kristin. damn me.

there was no spinal tap video; we watched 'are you my neighbor' instead, followed by a savior machine video. it was an odd combination to say the least, and i drifted off post-ice-cream-bar while savior machine droned on. quotable from jake: "No, listen... some of these songs have a melody!" danny's mom knows daystar people. yuk yuk yuk.

saturday morning i regained consciousness, sprawled on the futon with danny's foot in my face and an external keyboard pressing into my chest. jake was on the floor, deacon on a nearby couch -- jason was a ball in one of the round wicker chairs that looks like a bowl. danny's little sisters were watching cartoons. and offering me a hamster as i came to. "His name is Fred," said the wry little sprite. the older of his two sibling-sisters has a constant look of kid-skepticism on her face; she is cute, and will no question grow moreso with age. i tried to hold the hamster but it decided it would rather crawl over my arm, off my arm, onto the futon, and make a run for the border.

i watched minutes and hours tick by and weighed the chances of a successful alison visit were i to get in contact with her. via aol, or hotmail, or /something/. but committing to that would have been... strange. so i watched it hit nine, then ten. then eleven, with gritted teeth and mixed knashing. at noon we got donuts and walked around aurora aeting them. dogs barked at us behind beaten wood fences, mothers watched us behind screen doors.

danny, jake and i, at least, managed to put together a pretty good tape for beck. i ad-libbed the part of jeff the squirrel on a radio call-in show that sounded vaguely reminiscent of teh radio shopping show. i also did the voice of rajul the squirrel-scrubber. "So, rajul... what do you use to scrub those squirrels?" "Trade secret. all 'hind closed doors." "Steel wool?" "Steel wool! It'd scrub them squirrels raw! You think I'm some kinda fool?"

my finset hour of improvisation, i think.

on the way home i finally managed to ask jason a serious question in between my minute-stretches of sullen pondering. on the way home we passed someone on coolidge who -- god help me -- looked for all the world like kristin. i jerked around in my seat and craned my neck to watch as she drove by us; jason just laughed at me but it dug into my chest. no matter how much i've tried to kick the 'crush' or 'attraction' to kristin, her image is still floating below the surface of my consciousness. projecting itself onto passers by.

worked on windows; scraping the glazing out with my pocketknife in the heat for a few hours. then ran out to carlson's. it was strange -- i had my compilation tape playing and braved the traffic to purchase mineral spirits, oil based primer, and glazing tacks. i parked on one side of the city, then realized that i needed to go to carlson's /hardware/, not paint. i walked across downtown wheaton, through crowds of couples bouncing around like happily bonded molecules. looked in windows and tried to think thoughts of how nice it would've been walking around with alison.

i arrived at carlson's /glass and mirrors/, not /hardware/, and stepped inside. behind the desk, the receptionist noticed me and stood up with a smile; i found myself staring at a dark-haired kristin and fumbled for my list of supplies to buy. she pointed me back down the street; "Oh, we've got a paint store down Front Street on the other side -- that's the one you want to go to!"

i'm sure i stared. it took me a moment to realize i'd just have to backtrack to the store i was parked next to, but i didn't care really. i was seeing dopplegangers again and i hated myself for it.

why can't i forget those feelings like a bad dream, laugh them off, and love alison?

sat. night. I talked to alison. she even thought of visiting despite my non-presence but declared it pathetic. i tore myself in two and we parted ways when she had to go to sleep.

sunday after church; talked to her again. about Jesus; love. future ambitions. she said to me that she was afraid; she wants a man of god, who'll lead her family and the whole deal. but feels... damaged. less than innocent and pure, the way she wants to be. she says that she doesn't know what she would have to offer the kind of man that she would want.

i had my first video conference ever, with somms and iona -- such a strange experience. i waggled larry in front of the camera and saw somms' face scrunch in a look of 2fps bewilderment. "what the hell was that?" iona laughed out loud as somms got auto-booted for profanity.
