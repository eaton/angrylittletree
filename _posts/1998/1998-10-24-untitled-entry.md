the dbsonica concert was great. hitched a ride with the scott parents after an illfated shopping run for mom's presents. found what i was seeking but it took a disoriented run down ogden road to do it.

once i made it to the heart and soul things were sweet. sound check had sounded great and they were all pumped for the show -- they were opening! it came off very well, but the montors were weirded out and they couldn't hear themselves playing. they were seriously bummed as they came offstage, but the enthusiastic response made up for it.

after the show, i realized the tha promoter for edan productions was talking to jason and the rest of the band. "So, if we had you guys play, what group would you want to play with?" they blinked lots and lots.

met a cool goth guy named edward. slicked black hair and a mellow, sorrowful expression. stiletto sideburns and a trench, with black boots that blended into black jeans. leather wraps around his arms sprung from a tshirt and merged into fingerless gloves. he wasn't insta-goth, just the real thing. they were all wowed when he came over -- three times -- after the show. told a couple members of db that he really liked the show, then talked to everybody for a while. jewelry and boot-purchasing tips were traded. he's very soft spoken; we found out he wasn't a christian, and on the way home beck and jason and i prayed for him.

got the whole concert on film, which should be cool.

missing alison. sigh. praying for her. hope she's okie in dc.
