I posted a clipping a few months ago, in which the UN claimed that child prostitution was 'terrorism.' It was an obvious, blatant attempt to piggyback on Terrorism As The New Universal Evil, rather than condemning child prostitution as morally repugnant in and of itself.

Now international media conglomerates are jumping on the bandwagon, too. They want all digital media to have manufacturer IDs burnt into the media, to make piracy more difficult. A <A HREF="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/020524/152/cznqd.html">Yahoo News</A> story quotes:

<I>To back up their demands, the media groups claim that counterfeiting and piracy of copyrighted works "feeds a growing black economy in which criminal networks use piracy to fund other activities such as drug dealing, arms trading, money laundering and terrorism."</I>

How patently absurd.
