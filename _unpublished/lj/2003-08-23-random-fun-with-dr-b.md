<a href="http://smoldering.livejournal.com">smoldering</a> pointed me to <a href="http://www.cbeinternational.org/new/index.html?body=/new/free_articles/challenge.html" target="_blank">this fun article by Dr. Gil Bilezikian</a> on the Biblical basis of "female subordination." It's a clear headed, Biblically consistent look at the fundamental flaws in interperetation that have led the church to exclude women from positions of ministry and leadership. A sample quote:

<blockquote><i>In the course of history, the church has often lost its way. For instance, during a thousand years, the church forgot something as crucial as the way of salvation and replaced it with methods of salvation by works that never worked. The biblical teaching was finally recovered by the Reformers just a few centuries ago.

Likewise, many present-day Christians believe that, along the way, the church has lost its own definition as community and replaced it with false definitions that reduce it to the status of institution, establishment, hierarchy, corporation and programs. This challenge provides an incentive to help Christians rediscover for themselves the biblical definition of the church as Godâ€™s community of oneness.

To anyone who might be tempted to think that this challenge is a feminist plot to subvert the traditional church, it should be pointed out that feminism is a quest for equal rights and equal power. A basic premise of this presentation is the exact opposite, the belief that the Bible requires all Christians to pursue relationships of mutual submission and of reciprocal servanthood.</i></blockquote>

Check it out. It's interesting stuff.
