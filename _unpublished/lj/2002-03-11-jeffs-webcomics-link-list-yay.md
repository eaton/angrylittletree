<B>The Gems</B>
These are comics I check daily, without fail, and always read back on if I've missed anything. The quality is consistent and they make me laugh far more often than they make me cringe or sigh.

<A HREF="http://www.comics.com/comics/getfuzzy/">Get Fuzzy</A>
Get Fuzzy is sublime. It is the Tao. It is what is pure and holy. I LOVE Get Fuzzy. Watch Human Rob, Siamese Bucky, and Pooch Satchel live in their apartment and adventure in the world beyond. It's perfect in the way that really great comics are -- sharp writing, funny-because-it's-true gags, and fresh spins on old if-pets-could-talk gags. Bucky is the paranoid megalomaniac cat, Satchel is the naive but noble dog, and Rob rides herd.

<A HREF="http://www.baldwinpage.com/bruno.html">Bruno</A>
Bruno is one of those strips that takes your breath away wit hits depth and visual quality. Chris Baldwin, the artist, has kept this strip going for more than half a decade as a labor of love -- the characters he creates are witty, wounded, wry and searching. The themes the strip deals with are often 'mature' -- suicide, sexuality, broken families and betrayal... but like real life, the gems are what you find when things are at their worst. Take this description as a fair warning -- if you're looking for punch lines and smiles, this is NOT the place to go.

<A HREF="http://www.megatokyo.com/">Megatokyo</A>
Megatokyo is beautiful, sweet, and fresh. The protagonist, Piro, is stuck in Japan with his best friend Largo -- and money to get home thanks to a drunken itinerary change at E3. They meet ninjas, sentient PS2 accessories, Piro's conscience (a diminutive winged cutie modeled after the artist's girlfriend) and binge on unsubbed anime. Largo brings us classic lines like 'ph34r /\/\y l33+ n3kkid 5k1llz,' while Piro's near constant self-doubt and wry commentary makes geeks worldwide say, 'Yes! Yes, that's me!'

<A HREF="http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3">Penny Arcade</A>
My best friend Jason and I maintain that this strip IS the alternate universe where we got an apartment togteher and invested heavily in gaming consoles. It warms the heart of anyone who's ever chewed their nails waiting for a Squaresoft product to ship. The jokes are likely to baffle anoyne who isn't plugged into the gaming community SOMEHOW, but the artsts are good at posting daily news updates to explain the obscure stuff. "Do you like my hat? It's made of MONEY."

<A HREF="http://www.machall.com/">Mac Hall</A>
Sure, sure, another gaming comic. But gimmie a break, I'm a geek. ;) This one has *excellent* full color art, a distinctive style, and a fun cast -- a college dorm full of Mac gaming freaks. Anyone who remembers why 'They're Everywhere!' is a bad thing to hear in a dark hallway will love this strip.

<A HREF="http://www.platinumgrit.com/">Platinum Grit</A>
This one is actually a print comic, with four complete issues converted to flash and posted on the web. It's high-quality high-surrealism stuff, following the adventures of the hapless Jeremy, the comely Nels, and a rogues gallery of exploding turtles, large-nosed bazooka wielding relatives, and talking wardrobes.
<B>The Sporadically Good Stuff</B>
These have moments of genius but are either often offensive, sometimes lame, or just don't make me laugh often enough to merit obsessive update-chechking. They're still good stuff though. Would I recommend bad comics? No. I don't think so.

<A HREF="http://www.venisproductions.com/angelmoxie/">Angel Moxie</A>
Fun, a little silly, and relatively new. This one is an anime-influenced snack about a junior high kid who has to save the world from Evil. The art is good if a bit tiny for my tastes, and it makes a good snack between helpings of the Real Meat.

<A HREF="http://www.inktank.com/AT/index.cfm">Angst Technologies</A>
Geeks, gaming, programming, and a monkey that does web design. I want to be Dante when I grow up.

<A HREF="http://www.avalonhigh.com/">Avalon High</A>
Canadian high school drama. It's Degrassi Junior High, with even more hockey references! This one used to be one of my gems but updates have been sporadic recently and most of the fun characters have been hard to find in a flurry of new plot arcs.

<A HREF="http://www.bobthegolfer.net/">Bob The Golfer</A>
Droll. Hypersaturated. Joy Electric References. Need I say more?

<A HREF="http://www.comics.com/comics/forbetter/">For Better or for Worse</A>
Yeah, yeah, this is about as un-indie as you can possibly get. I remember looking through the sunday paper and wondering what people found funny about disjointed plot-free strips like The Antics of A Dog Shaking Itself In The Hallway, or A Child Not Cleaning Her Room On Time. Then I discovered the daily strips. They follow an actual *story arc,* with college co-eds shacking up and cheating on each other, newlyweds grappling with the ups and downs of the freelance writing trade, and other Actually Interesting Plot Concepts. Give it a whirl or two and see if you don't change your mind.

<A HREF="http://www.gpf-comics.com/">General Protection Fault</A>
This one isn't quite as zany and off-kilter as PG, Sluggy or Megatokyo, but it's got a fun consistent storyline revolving around a small software development company called 'GPF.' Yes. You're allowed to snicker.

Both <A HREF="http://www.goats.com/">Goats</A> and <A HREF="http://www.krazylarry.com/">Krazy Larry</A>...
These are funny in that Bobcat Goldwaith sickly-amusing wouldn't-want-to-live-next-to-him sort of way. There are some twisted, surreal laughs at the expense of good taste.

<A HREF="http://www.pvponline.com/">Player Versus Player</A>
Follow the staff of a fictional gaming magazine as they live, love, laugh, break up, and win fragfests against killer llamas.

<A HREF="http://www.reallifecomics.com/">Real Life</A>
This one is a lightweight but fun strip that's never been offensive to the best of my knowledge. It's got a distinctive Adobe Illustrator look to the artwork, and it's heavy on the geek-life jokes. If you've ever been addicted to Everquest, you'll find something to love.

<A HREF="http://students.washington.edu/durandal/shawisland/">Shaw Island</A>
Sometimes offensive but generally hilarious. Two guys living on an island off the coast of Washington, working on the ferry that carts tourists to and fro. Gaming, relationships, and sentient hamsters at war with evil lobsters. Uh... yeah.

<A HREF="http://www.sinfest.net/">Sinfest</A>
This one is on-and-off funny, with some offensive-silly content and a few moments of genius. Ignore Slick's attempts to bed anything that moves, pay attention to Percy and Pooch, the feline/canine duo that makes Play With Ball time look like the best thing since Disneyworld.

<A HREF="http://www.sluggy.com/">Sluggy Freelance</A>
Potato-eating aliens and switchblade wielding rabbits and web designers and killer robots and ferrets that go 'poing!' and anime cyborgs. This is the cartoon that makes hallucinations look like the simple explaination.

<A HREF="http://www.bobbins.org/">Bobbins</A>
Imagine a British version of Friends. But it's a comic. And one of the characters is an international super spy. Who likes kittens.

<A HREF="http://www.wintercomic.com/">Winter</A>
This one is 'Serious' anime-style drama, an unfolding story set in a war-torn city. Brother, sister, friends, broken family, intrigue... Etc etc. The only downside is the pencil-art that's sometimes hard to make out.
