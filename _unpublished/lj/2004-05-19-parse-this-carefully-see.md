I'm heading out to work, but I had CSPAN on while I was getting ready to leave. Gen. Geoffrey Miller, Deputy Commander for Detainee Ops in Iraq, is <a href="http://www.c-span.org/watch/index.asp?Cat=TV&Code=CS&ShowVidDays=30&ShowVidDesc=">testifying before the Senate</a> about prisoner abuse. I was struck by the carefully worded tricky-to-parse answer he gave when asked, "What has changed since the abuses?"

He replied that, when he visited recently, he spoke to every commander and almost every soldier he could find, and "...found men who follow their orders, one hundred percent, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day."

"So, things have changed dramatically?"

"These men follow their orders."

"Thank you, General."

I suppose the implied meaning is that if the soldiers in question had followed their orders, nothing would've happened -- but that's a question currently under investigation as well. It's a little unsettling that the question "Have things changed?" was never directly answered. The more I watch televised hearings, the more I notice that no one ever answers. Every statement is constructed in such a way that an impression is given, but no falsififiable claim is ever made. It's like everyone is taking cues from Clinton's "I did not have sex with that woman" line.

<blockquote><i>Q Ari, other than Elliott Abrams, how many convicted criminals are on the White House staff?
 
MR. FLEISCHER: (Laughter.) You tell me, Russell. You seem to keep count.
 
Q Can you give me a list of convicted criminals on the White House staff, other than Elliott Abrams?
 
MR. FLEISCHER: I'll go right to the convicted criminals division and ask them to turn -- (Laughter.)
 
Q No, seriously -- why isn't being convicted of a criminal a disqualifier for being on the White House staff?
 
MR. FLEISCHER: Russell, this is an issue that you like to repeat every briefing. I refer you to the --
 
Q But you don't answer --
 
MR. FLEISCHER: -- repeat I gave you the third time you asked it, which matched the second, which corresponded to the first.</i></blockquote>
