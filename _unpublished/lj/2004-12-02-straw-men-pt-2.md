<blockquote><i>At least a part of the Western left -- or rather the Western far left -- is now so anti-American, or so anti-Bush, that it actually prefers authoritarian or totalitarian leaders to any government that would be friendly to the United States.</i></blockquote>

Thus spoke <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A23721-2004Nov30.html"> Anne Applebaum in yesterday's Washington Post,</a> quoted helpfully by <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/019587.php">The Instapundit.</a> The problem, of course, is that the statement is childishly simplistic. Anyone who's paid attention to the past several years of national debate knows that even the "Far Left" doesn't prefer dictators to democracies -- they oppose the specific <i>means</i> by which our nation has gone about removing the totalitarian leaders. In the case of Iraq in particular, Even the Michael Moore/Moveon.org elements of the crowd believe that the rewards for the US, Iraq, and the world are outweighed by the regional and ideological damage done by a military invasion and occupation.

You can agree or disagree with that belief -- you can say that <i>any</i> price is worth the abstract notion of 'freedom' for another country. But it's either rank stupidity or cold-hearted lying to say that these people simply "hate America so much they prefer totalitarian leaders to friendly governments." There are other complaints with Applebaum's simple sentence -- the fact that many of the governments "friendly to us" <i>are and have been</i> totalitarian, the fact that Bush and America are treated as a single conceptual unit, and so on... but they're not worth spending time on.

The same sort of broad-stroke painting goes on on the left, as well. It's easy to say that those "on the right" hate unbelievers and are trying to build an Old-Testament driven military police-state full of mindless consumers to feed corporate coffers. Cruise the blogs and message boards, and you'll actually find folks on the left who believe that statement. Not in the <i>Washington Times</i>, though. Or even the much-maligned <i>New York Times</i>, often cited as a bastion of leftist editorialism.

The solution? People on both sides of the fence need to grow up. Those on the left need to realize that 'the right' is probably NOT trying to create a police state bent on conquering the world for Jesus, and those on the right need to take a deep breath and grow up, realizing that those who disagree with them are NOT anti-american terrorist lovers. It's an easy trick, like calling your opponent a Nazi in a debate. And sadly, most of the nation will respond to it in knee-jerk fashion. Lying, sadly, does sometimes pay.

That doesn't make it right.
