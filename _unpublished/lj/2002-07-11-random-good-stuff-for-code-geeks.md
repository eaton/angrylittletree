<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel on Software</a>
It's a software blog. How cool is that? Joel is the head of a tiny little company making a cool little product for managing frequently updated web sites. He also blogs like a mutha', and his thoughts on software development and industry events are always interesting, even if I don't agree with them.

<a href="http://www.sdmagazine.com">Software Development Online</a>
An all around nifty magazine that covers a number of languages and platforms without pushing a specific architectural agenda (Cough MSDN Cough Cough).

<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture">The Microsoft .Net Architecture</a>
If you're trying to figure out what the heck .Net really looks like underneath all the press releases, this page gives a great nitty gritty tour of the architecture itself, with oodles of sample code, sample apps, and the like.

<a href="http://patterndigest.com/main/sortcategory.html">Pattern Digest Category Index</a>
Mmmmmm. Fun with patterns! This site lists descriptions and diagrams of the most common Gang of Four patterns, along with a number of others that have been recognized as Genuine Articles. Also check out <a href="http://www.enteract.com/~bradapp/docs/patterns-intro.html">Patterns and Software Essential Concepts and Terminology</a> if you're not familiar with the lingo.

<a href="http://www.antipatterns.com">AntiPatterns</a>
The dark and evil side of software development: antipatterns. These are the commonly repeated mistakes, the architectural solutions the seem like a good idea at the time but come back to bite you later. Learn by reading and avoiding, or learn by implementing and regretting.

<a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/readinglist.php">Adaptive Path Reading List</a>
The Adaptive Path guys are some pretty clueful User Interaction consultants, and they've assembled a killer reading list full of UI and general usability information. It's not just web related, either.

<a href="http://www.codeproject.com">The Code Project</a>
Sample code. Lots and lots of sample code. Heavy emphasis on the VB family, but the layout is nice and it links to a lot of off-site resources that have additional content.

<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/intercal">INTERCAL Resource Page</a>
Ah, who can ignore INTERCAL, that most twisted of novelty languages? A language that eschews the GOTO construct in favor of COME FROM. A language whose name is an acroynm for "Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym." A language that now supports threading!

<a href="http://www.catseye.mb.ca/esoteric/index.html">Cat's Eye Technologies</a>
If you're looking for more twisted novelty languages, programming oddities, and general geekish amusement, this place is great. Find out about languages like Brainf*ck (Turing-complete with only 8 instructions!), TURKEY BOMB (It's a language... it's a drinking game! No, it's a language AND a drinking game!) and far, far more.
