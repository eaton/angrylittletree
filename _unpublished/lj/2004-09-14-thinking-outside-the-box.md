<CODE>&lt;verb&gt; We need a pokemon-based military. 
&lt;verb&gt; Send out a brigade of eleven year olds who control electricity-based dragons. 
&lt;protobofh&gt; What if the Iraqis have water type pokemon?
&lt;verb&gt; crap, you're right. We'll have to counter. 
&lt;protobofh&gt; MOAB, I choose you!
&lt;protobofh&gt; Use blow shit the hell up attack, now!
&lt;protobofh&gt; We don't know what kind of pokemon Saddam was making in those mobile pokemon labs.
&lt;Ajax&gt; We'll just have to make our moms let us stay up later than Iraqi moms let their kids stay up.
&lt;Ajax&gt; And win by attrition.
&lt;protobofh&gt; They'll take back any gains we make the next morning, as they'll be rested and we'll be cranky.
&lt;protobofh&gt; I think the only answer to this is to call in the Garbage Pail Kids.
&lt;Ajax&gt; We may need to ally with the Sour Patch Kids too.
&lt;protobofh&gt; Only then can we prevail.</CODE>
