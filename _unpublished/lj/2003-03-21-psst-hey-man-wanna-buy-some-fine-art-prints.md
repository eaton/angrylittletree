So I'm sitting at my desk trying to figure out what's up with the image precaching code on the interstitial page for the site's search engine when this artsy looking brunette in a suede jacket wanders in. "Hey," she says apologetically to Julie, the first person she runs into. "I'm from So-and-so-and-so-and-so, a design firm downtown? We just finished redoing one of the offices upstairs, and we still have some art left over from the work... My boss just told me to knock on a couple of the offices in the building, and see if they were interested..."

She walked around the office and asked <i>every single person.</i> Joe, the sysadmin, walks out of the server room wearing a Fucketh Not With Me look, makes eye contact, and growls, "Not interested." He was the only one to escape.

I mean... isn't this usually done with speakers, in a van or something? Is there anyone out there who's purchased "discount fine art prints" from someone knocking on their office door and posing as a wandering interior designer? Some sort of Feng Shui/Color Coordination Ronan?
