So I took some bread in for paul today, hoping to unload some excess  carbohydrates on a willing recipient. paul accepted with a look of shock, poring over the ingredients with characteristic thoroughness. "This is really /healthy/ bread, he said reverently while clutching a loaf of irish soda bread. "Where do you /get/ this?"  i grinned.

i drafted a rather comprehensive plan with six major feature and core changes to the site for this redesign. The frightening part of this is that after all this goal-setting and outlining, I'm actually feeling bullish about the idea of an inhouse redesign. Knowing tht the ecommerce stuff is built on ColdFusion has given me supernatural levels of confidence...

And checking out a host of ecommerce sites, the mockups that Image Group presented, and other stuff... well... I've actually got some ideas for the visual look and feel. Sigh. I'm wondering if I should whip up something to pitch him.

My CD addiction careens on, unabated: I found a cheap copy of New Order's Power, Corruption, Lies and snagged it at the used shop. Paul immediately spotted it on my desk and drooled. Urbal beats was found at the same shop and snagged: Rabbit In The Moon is my new favorite artist/group/something of the minute.

22 doesn't feel much different than anything else, really. Although it feels good to be an even number again. I wondered, back on my birthday, what Maria was doing. What it would've been like to be able to share even a few minutes of it with her. Over distance or not. I couldn't comprehend it. Although it still hurts as badly as ever, I'm losing the ability to remember her 'sense.'

I don't know if that's a part of healing, or a part of growing callouses on my heart.
