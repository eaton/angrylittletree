<A HREF="http://www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html">Real-World Relativity: The GPS Navigation System</a> -- And you thought the theory of relativity was useless and abstract! Turns out, it's what keeps things in sync with the GPS system used by everything from commercial aircraft to cruise missiles to private fishing boats to rental cars. If the system didn't account for relativistic time-shifting, it would be "akin to measuring my location while standing on my front porch in Columbus, Ohio one day, and then making the same measurement a week later and having my GPS receiver tell me that my porch and I are about 5000 meters in the air somewhere over Dayton, Ohio."

<a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/112904A.html">Faculty Clubs and Church Pews</a> -- TechCentralStation has a startlingly good article by William Stuntz on the strange divide between the evangelical world and the academic one. I've been fascinated by it ever since I read <i>The Myth of Certainty</i> by Daniel Taylor, an excellent book that explores the life of one caught between both worlds. Stuntz explores the ideas that could -- and should -- bridge the gap, touching on key shared values of the two worlds and the misunderstandings that keep them apart. It's a good read.

<a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/articleprint.php?num=95">The Derrida Industry</a> -- a fun, quick smackdown of fawning Derrida obituaries. <i>"he devoted his professional life to obfuscation and increasing the amount of ignorance in the world: by "teaching" legions of earnest individuals how to read badly and think carelessly. He may have been a morally decent man, but he led a bad life, and his legacy is one of shame for the humanities."</i>

A couple of new stories have interesting details about the genetic roots of <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,65839,00.html">sleep disorders</a> and <a href="http://feed.proteinos.com/002437.html">nicotine addiction</a>. <i>However, a predisposition for nicotine addiction does not mean that somebody will also become addicted or remain addicted. Smokers who have a genetic disposition can still stop smoking, even though they probably belong to the group who finds it hardest to quit.</i> 

Other genetic news is less happy. According to the UN, <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1383404,00.html">China, India and Russia are on the brink of an Africa-style Aids epidemic that could devastate the global economy and international security.</a> Meanwhile, the World Health Organization is floating warnings about a possible pandemic that could kill tens to hundreds of millions of people. <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/29/news/flu.html">While many influenza experts have discussed similar figures privately, Omi's remarks represented the first time a top public health official had given such an estimate in public.... Dr. Malik Peiris, a top influenza researcher at Hong Kong University, said that Omi's range of potential fatalities was realistic and consistent with current research into the A(H5N1) avian influenza virus.</a> Um. Hmmm. Eek.

Non-biological entities are picking up some slack for us while we panic. <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,65885,00.html">"As early as March or April, 18 units of the Talon -- a [robot] armed with automatic weapons -- are scheduled to report for duty in Iraq. Around the same time, the first prototypes of a new, unmanned ambulance should be ready for the Army to start testing."</a> I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords. Wired also covers <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,65866,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_5">mutating, shape-shifting robots that can crawl through small holes, climb stairs, cross gaps or go through rubble.</a> envisioned by researchers. <i>"Mark  Yim's robo-centipede will allow search-and-rescue personnel to look for survivors in a collapsed building by dropping the robot through a 4-inch hole drilled into the wall."</i>
