Natalie: Must Like A Pill be played every 4 minutes in this country?
Natalie: yes, I get it...you're going to run just as fast as you can to the middle of nowhere.  you can't stay on his morphine because it's making you itch.  I applaud you for rhyming that with switch and bitch.

Jeff Eaton: And the irony is profound.
Jeff Eaton: Who would have thought -- instead of making her better, he just keeps making her ill?

Natalie: my question is this...
Natalie: don't pills normally make you better?
Natalie: isn't that the theory behind medicine?
Natalie: or, does she mean pill in the hip and cool young kids meaning of pill as in "i pop pills"

Jeff Eaton: Or perhaps there's an "Instead" we're missing in the backbeat.
Jeff Eaton: As in, "You're just like a pill, *EXCEPT* instead of makign me better you keep making me ill."

Natalie: you do hear what i hear though, right?

Jeff Eaton: "You're just like a can of Pepsi, EXCEPT you're not at all."
Natalie: it's all so confusing.
Jeff Eaton: and so on.

Natalie: ah, this could be.
Natalie: little old me just thought in her concern for rhyming, she messed up the theory

Jeff Eaton: So the song, essentially, boils down to, 'Hi. You suck. I'm going to go rhyme."

Natalie: i bought the cutest toque/mitts/scraf set today. I'm especially witty when I make fun of Pink while trying it all on.
Natalie: except for the mitts, they make typing hard.
Natalie: the mitts are just like a pill, instead of making me better, they make it hard to type.

Jeff Eaton: Indeed!
