Amazing sometimes how a cartoon can capture the essence of a relationship. My ex and I used to read Bruno Baldwin (the webcomic linked from the strip above) religiously. She identified a lot with the main character -- the frizzy-haired deep-thinker on the left. The strip has always been excellent; it's complex, intelligent, sometimes hilarious and other times brutally painful to read. It's a life story kind of deal, not a collection of punchlines.

The background to the strip above is that Bruno and Sean had been dating for several months. She'd been happier with him than she had in a long time, but slipped into one of the extended philosophical funks that characterizes her life. Decided that she wasn't happy enough with him, or that something must be wrong with it, and the relationship broke up in a fit of indecision. Sean wanted to be with her but was unwilling to stay if she couldn't decide whether she even wanted him. And so, they split up. About a month (?) later, she's heartbroken... and this scene arrives.

Just... kind of weird. Meloncholy. Don't mind me.
