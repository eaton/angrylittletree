I think my previous entry (now expunged) was a little vague. I'll step back and give a little background. For about seven or eight years, various friends and I have been kicking around a project we call "Havana Moderne." It's part RPG sourcebook, part novella, part comic book, part online game, part self-indulgent exercise in futurism. We get to scour over weird cutting edge research, dig into global economics and kick around social theory. Havana Mod is an excuse to indulge our fetish for learning and analysis, really.

Still, it's freaky when things we call actually <i>happen.</i>

One of the background elements in the Havana-History was the idea that a cure for AIDS had been developed by a skunk-works research project sometime before 2010. Problem was, the cure was a modified version of the HIV virus itself, hacked to function as a 'countervirus,' spreading via the same vectors that the deadly one used. We predicted certain ripple-effects out from that development, international reactions to the idea, and so on and so forth. The idea was based on the concept of transmissible gene therapy -- letting viral vectors do the hard work of actually delivering a targetted genetic hack to the recipient.

Today, on the web....

<i><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,63441,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_1" target="_blank">BERKELEY, California -- It took Adam Arkin and David Schaffer just $200,000 and a grad student to develop a potential treatment for AIDS. And that scares them. That's because the therapy itself is a virus. 

...

The treatment is made of a gutted HIV virus. The harmful parts of the virus are removed, and in their place the researchers have inserted a DNA cargo that inhibits HIV's ability to kill immune cells. It latches onto the natural HIV and spreads along with it, even from person to person.

If this process sounds familiar, it's because it is essentially gene therapy, albeit a transmissible gene therapy. But the term "gene therapy" has fallen out of favor because of a handful of fatalities in clinical trials and, after nearly three decades of research, no gene therapy method has been proven to work consistently. </a></i>

'Nuff said.
