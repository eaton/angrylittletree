Welcome to the first day of the rest of my life. I started work at Willow Creek today; showed up at 10:00 to meet with Mark Kemink and wound up catching Mike... How fortuiutous! The next several hours were a dizzying parade of introductions, inside scoops, tutorials, and laughter. I thought for a while that I'd met everyone in the building, but I'm sure that more will follow. The guy I'm sitting next to is the office pessimist -- he reminds me of a cross between Matt Laswell and Nate in terms of wit. Turns out he's an Echoing Green/Miles Davis fan. Amazing!

I learned of office politics and upcoming design decisions... Did my first site update and got a feel for the structure... all in all, a good day. It's too late to give more detailed summaries... but Jason and I crashed out after work, and watched Larry-Boy... a fitting end for a great day. I'm pumped.
