i am struck this evening by the fact that my family is populated by absolute loons. myself included. i offer as an example, this brief dinnertime conversation:

"Jeff, eat your fajita, it's getting cold."
"Shh. I've weakened it with my initial attack, but I'm planning the follow up."
"It doesn't look very strong."
"Well, it expects me to come through that way again. It would be folly to play into its hands like that."
"I'll tell it of your plans!"
"You wouldn't!"

Another example involves the phrase, "Wait, did you mean dad's robot drone aircraft, or my army of mindless minions?" Only at my dinner table can that question get a straight answer.

I think we all need sleep very, very badly.
