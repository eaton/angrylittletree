Cry havoc and let fly the dogs of Oracle 8i... Oh, for the happy days of SQL Server 2000, when getting XML from the DB was a simple function call away.

What is it about late nights battling nasty techie snafus that's both invigorating and depressing at the same time?  I think it relates directly to how many people you know who are out doing something social while you're debugging...

The obvious solution? Get *all* your friends together and have a debugging party. Nothing says fun like drinks, appetizers, and Visual Studio 6!
