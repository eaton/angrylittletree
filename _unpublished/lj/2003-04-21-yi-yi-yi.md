Prayers, well-wishes, and large suitcases full of cash are welcome. Tomorrow around 9:00 I'll be interviewing with <a href="http://www.rvsinfo.com/">Retail Vision Systems</a>, a local company developing swanky retail automation software in C#. It'd be a chance to work in a language and architecture that I enjoy, it'd be far closer to home (20 minute commute instead of 80...) and so on. I'd also be working with <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> -- something I haven't had a chance to do for a couple of years.

No pressure, but if it is a good fit and I'd be able to help the company, it sounds like a really cool opportunity...
