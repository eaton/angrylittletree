<pre>bliss says, "today i got an envelope in the mail, unmarked."
dv8 [to bliss]: what was in it?
bliss [to dv8]: a cassette tape and a map.
dv8 [to bliss]: go on
bliss [to dv8]: the outside of the envelope just said, 'Be in your car. use
the cassete first.'
dv8 says, "uh oh"
april asks, "have you listened tot he tape yet?"
bliss [to dv8]: so i went out and got into my car and put it in, and it
started playing. it was a computer generated voice.
bliss nods to april.
bliss says, "it said, 'Everything you've known is wrong. You will live and
die by the words on this tape. Follow these instructions, or the mission
will fail.'"
april says, "ooo, go on"
bliss says, "in the sort of jerky odd pronunciation of synth speech."
april nods.
bliss says, "it went on to outline directions, and noted that if i needed to
remember them, to use the pen and  paper included in the envelope. because
there would not be a second chance."
april says, "err"
april asks, "no rewind?"
bliss says, "the directions included following the map, parking in a
particular spot, and walking to a particular intersection, and waiting for
the train to pass."
april Erms.
bliss says, "it then said, this tape will self destruct in ten seconds."
bliss says, "and it did."
dv8 says, "meme is on crack again"
bliss says, "the tape snapped after ten seconds, and wound up inside the
case so it couldn't be rewound."
april nods, just a weak bit in the tape, I see.
april asks, "did you do the things it said?"
bliss shakes. "No, it was perfect. It said, 'This tape will
self-destruct...' and in ten seconds, it snapped and self-destructed.
bliss says, "so i waited for half an hour at that intersection and a train
passed and when it passed, there was a guy there in a trench coat on the
other side of the tracks. trench coat, shades, black fedora, and an umbrella
that he was leaning on like a cane."
april says, "good greif"
april asks, "are you joking with us?"
Esseffen asks, "then what?"
bliss says, "I tip my cap and he walks over to me and it's my friend dan.
but all he does is hand me half a playing card -- the ace of spades -- with
a street address on it."
bliss [to april]: i swear to God I'm not joking.
bliss [to april]: they have it on tape actually. because they had another
person hiding in the parking lot taping the whole thing.
april nods.
bliss [to april]: so i go there and one of my other friends walks through
the stoor holding /my/ camcorder. he's all in black leather and shades, and
he just walks by, no comment, and out the back entrance of the store into
the alley behind it. i turn around and there's someone else standing there
and they hand me a red candy and say, 'Take the red pill and go get some
more candy."
april says, "go on!"
bliss [to april]: I pop it, swallow, and wander to the candy store next
door, where the attendants give me these really weird looks, and keep giving
me glances while I wait in line.
bliss says, "I kill time, kill more time, and go ou;to  chill outside the
store and eat some popcorn. across the street there's these two girls who
are watching me the whole 10, 15 minutes i'm there. but they never say
anything, so i wander back into the store."
bliss says, "at which point this kid on a bike pulls up outside the door and
walks in and taps me on the shoulder and says, 'There are breaded mushrooms
in your future.'"
april blinks.
bliss says, "this kind of cloak and dagger stuff goes on for a while, at
which point I think I'm putting two and two together. So I wander out and
pay these kids two bucks to go back nd check out where my car was parked."
bliss says, "and tell whoever's there that I took the red pill."
april nods.
april says, "go on!"
april . o O ( this is better than a movie )
bliss says, "I walk outside and round the corner. at which point the guy who
handed me the playing card, the dude in the trench with the umbrella, rounds
it and says, 'Change of plans. The organization has been compromised.
Proceed back to the candy store. ask them if the wallabees are biting.""
bliss says, "and then turns into a store and disappears into the crowd."
bliss says, "I do."
april nods.
bliss says, "And the pothead behind the counter who was giving me looks
earlier just reaches behind the counter and hands me this big airborn
express box."
atma says, "hm "
april asks, "and??"
bliss says, "I take it, walk outside, and peel the electrical tape off of it
in the middle of the sidewalk. there's about 2 pounds of penny candy
inside."
april blinks.
bliss says, "and i dig through it and i find a rubber ducky and a note that
says, 'Go to the theater.'"
Esseffen laughs.
Esseffen says, "this is too much. "
bliss says, "meanwhile, these kids arrive back to tell me that there was
some guy in leather getting into my car."
april grins.
Esseffen says, "somebody really loves you"
bliss [to Esseffen]: My friends are a twisted bunch. The problem is now,
they've thrown down the gauntlet.
bliss grins wickedly.
bliss is going to top this.
Esseffen grins.
bliss says, "So I arrive at the theatre, or more apppropriately, the alley
near the theater, and dawn is standing there, in the middle of this squeaky
white-bread city, dressed in black vinyl, boots, and a silver rubberized
top, with wraparound mirrorshades."
bliss says, "She doesn't say a word, just tosses me the other half of the
ace of spades and it says, 'go to blockbuster. ask for jason and put the
duck on the counter.'"
april says, "this is so very matrix"
bliss [to april]: yes, well, the fact that we all watched the movie 4 times
was kind of apparent.
bliss chuckles.
Esseffen laughs.
bliss says, "so I do, and as I'm there, in the store, my car pulls up
outside the store."
bliss says, "stopping in the middle of traffic, right in the center of the
dotted line."
april blinks.
bliss says, "And my friend Jason's in the driver's seat, with the dupe key
they got, pointing the camcorder right at me. I salute the manager of the
store, walk out into the middle of the road, step into the passenger's side,
and he peels off."
bliss says, "And we drove to dinner and then watched a movie."
bliss says, "the whole gang, that is."
bliss says, "All in all, an interesting afternoon. :)"
