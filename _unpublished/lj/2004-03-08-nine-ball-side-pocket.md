Had dinner with <a href="http://rdecker.livejournal.com">rdecker</a> a few nights ago. Good sushi, good conversation, and a lot of planning for something I'll be kicking off next month (hopefully). had a lot to think about afterwards, and I spent an hour or so alone in the clubhouse of my apartment complex, shooting pool and practicing strange angled shots. I'm gettng better, slowly but surely. It's funny how soothing and centering the rhythm of the game is when you're playing solo, with an old U2 song looping in your headphones. Oldschool songs from Joshua Tree, and the clack of the cue ball. Good times. Good times.

In other news, I think this is reason enough for the Human Extinction project to begin: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=493207">X-Men/Trading Spaces crossover romance fan fiction.</a>

Need I say more?
