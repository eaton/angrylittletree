So over the past few months, controversy has been brewing over the music industry's attempts to make destructive hacking legal.

What? What's that, you say? No, not just any hacking... Only hacking done by the RIAA in order to cripple the computers of individuals suspected of sharing copyrighted files.

The shoe has finally dropped: <A HREF="http://www.informationwave.net/news/20020819riaa.php">InfoWave Technologies</A> has officially blocked all traffic from RIAA servers,</A> alleging that [the RIAA] policy puts [our] customers at risk of unintentional damage, corporate espionage, and invasion of privacy to say the least."  They're setting up honeypots to lure and log RIAA hacking attempts. They're announcing their plans to the world and encouraging others to do the same.

Yeah.

Rock.
