Just finished <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345430778/102-7123199-1056904"><I>Manifold Space</I>, by Stephen Baxter.</A> Interesting fun book -- it's a little hard to follow at first, since it takes place over about 8000 years, following the lives of a couple key chraacters who cheat death with quantum tricks and try to stop impending galactic destruction. One of the signs I'm a complete shameless geek is that while I love good solid literature, I'm also a sucker for so-so writing with dazzlingly cool tech concepts. Dyson colonies around dying stars, mining crystalized oxygen from the core of the moon, giant superconducting cables wrapped around Mercury like a net, turning its iron core into a magnet for a generator the likes of which <A HREF="http://www.ucm.com/comed/main.asp">ComEd</A> would <A HREF="http://www.newtimesla.com/issues/2002-03-07/faultlines.html/1/index.html">sell their grandmothers</A> to own ... fun stuff like that. And concepts -- galactic 'reboots' that wipe out live for hundreds of thousands of light-years, alien races of iron-lichen that live on the surfaces of neutron stars, with fourteen-second generations illustrating the illusory nature of emergent life...

So yeah -- while the writing wasn't exceptional and the characterization was weak, I did enjoy it a lot. It did redeem itself with a galactic-scale whodunnit: who's been killing off sentient races for billions of millenia? <A HREF="http://www.kidsreads.com/funstuff/trivia/brown-triv.asp">time to call encyclopedia brown!</A>
