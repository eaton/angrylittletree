<center><b>A Tale of Two Armies
Courage and Cynicism Battle for the Hearts of Our Nation
A Comparision of G.I. Joe: The Movie, and Full Metal Jacket</b></center>

In these days of fear and uncertainty, of moral and military conflict between the forces of Good and Evil, television, film and literature play an important role in sustaining our nation's spirit. Today we'll take a closer look at two movies both released in 1987, a decade after the end of the Vietnam war. Stanley Kubrick's <i>Full Metal Jacket,</i> a lavishly produced Vietnam retrospective, follows the path of the cynical Pvt. Joker from basic training to the jungles of Southeast Asia. The second, Don Jurwich's seminal <i>G.I. Joe: The Movie,</i> is a rousing call to arms for all freedom-loving Americans.

As the film closes, our reluctant hero Pvt. Joker shoots a young girl who's caught sniping from an abandoned building. Though his squad cheers his bravery he is still uncertain, a sad picture of the debilitating effects of unchecked media criticism on our nation's brave soldiers. In contrast, <i>G.I. Joe: The Movie,</i> raises the bar for heroism and self-sacrifice. After learning the value of teamwork and Old Glory, Flint is not only willing to lay down his life for his fellow men, he singlehandedly defeats an entire regiment of biologically engineered mutant snake-men. Does he regret this act? No. Flint understands that the price of freedom truly is eternal vigilance.

Further demonstrating the director's commitment to the greater good, <i>G.I. Joe: The Movie,</i> concludes with a 30-minute series of public service announcements explaining the dangers of swimming without a lifeguard, or spray-painting in a closed garage. <i>Full Metal Jacket,</i> on the other hand, portrays a young Vietnamese child sniping with a fully loaded AK-47, a clear glorification of gun ownership.
