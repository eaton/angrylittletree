So it's the first day of my final week of work. Very strange. I know I'm going to miss the people I've been working with for the past year -- so many of them were cut in the last round of firings, though, that it's felt like a different company anyway.

Everyone needs friends willing to tell them when they're screwing up. Willing to point out screwed up destructive patterns, call them on it, and help. I think too much of what passes for kindness and love -- even in my own heart -- is really just fear. Fear of being rejected by the person I'm talking to, fear of being seen as uncaring or harsh... you know how it goes.

on the plus side of things, it looks like some freelance work is opening up; it should help keep me going while I do the job hunt thing.
