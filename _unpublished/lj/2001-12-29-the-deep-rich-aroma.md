i've always known in the abstract that smells can be associated with memories but it really hit home last night. i'm normally a starbucks kind of guy, or at least whatever good blend i can get my hands on when i need my fix. i ran out to the store last night, though,  and grabbed a cheap jar of folgers' instant for emergencies. around 1 or 2 in the morning i boiled a cup and spooned in some coffee and... for a good twenty seconds i was back in my grandparents' house in elkhart, indiana. age 6 or 7, sitting at the kitchen table. chin resting on the table while they played cards and drank sherry and brewed endless, endless pots of folgers.

that particular blend is so completely and utterly associated with them in my mind. they would bring it here when they visited and the kitchen would smell of it... my grandpa would keep a thermos of it with him when he drove, and it would fill the car every time he cracked it open.

it was so strange... i sat there for a few minutes, eyes closed, just inhaling it. the stuff tastes like crap, it's cheap coffee with more bite than flavor... but seriously. i'd have paid anything for that couple of minutes, remembering grandma and grandpa and just *experiencing* those memories all over again.

words fail.
