I think one of the strangest things about the present conflict is that it's almost impossible to work up a sense of <i>righteousness</i> about it, without appealing to fuzzy tentative associations. We're not really defending ourselves, we haven't stepped in to right some obvious, visible, media-friendly wrong that's been done... it's just... strange, and abstract and distant. The fact that the 'war' is being waged mostly be remote controlled explosives is a big change as well.

The troops we do have are now grinding towards Bagdhad in a 20-mile long caravan of armor and steel -- there will be casualties, but the atmosphere is so radically different from most other conflicts we've experienced before. It's surreal. I think the true repercussions will come in the years to follow -- the changes in international relations, in attitudes towards the US.

We act a bit like everyone's kind big brother right now, I think. But the world asked us not to beat up Iraq, and we did it anyways. From this point on, we will be seen very very differently -- not as a nation interested in participating as an equal in the community of nations, but as The Big Kid who decides, at his liesure, to play nicely with the others.

The first hints of that attitude were seen when the present administration implied publically that Palestinians could elect any democratic leader they wished -- as long as he had no <i>terrorist ties</i>. Although we would certainly prefer that, the idea of democracy is that the individuals in question choose their own fate. The reconstruction of Iraq will likely be riddled with these types of issues.

The memory of this conflict will live on for many, many decades.
