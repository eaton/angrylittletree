[upon being asked how my faith affects my life on a daily basis]

That's an easy and a difficult question simultaneously. In some ways it's like asking how "being carbon-based" plays a role in my day. It colors everything, from how I view the events around me to how I weigh my decisions.

Other times? It feels as if I'm a rope made of two cords -- my faith, and my flesh. One is pulled by the temptations, the shortcuts, the easy fixes that I wish I could throw myself at. But the second cord that my flesh is bound to -- my faith -- won't let me. At times like that, my faith feels like a stone around my neck. A burden. An ache. I know in my head that it's not, but it does, at times.

It's the back and forth pull that we all experience, I think.

In the day to day, how does it play out?

It might be something as simple as me smiling to the tollbooth operator and saying, 'Thanks!' when I give them 50 cents.

It might be what makes me shrug and say, 'No, not really, that's not my style' when a guy at a club point sto a hot girl and says, 'Hey, would you do her?'

It's why I take the time to pray and try to listen before making major decisions -- the small things too, but especially when Things Are On The Line. It's about trying to step back and ask God what it is that He wants instead of just what sounds good.

It's why I'm annoying and don't tell the kid at the movie theater that I'm a student when I buy my ticket, even though I'm not.

It's why I ask forgiveness when my careless words -- or intentionally hurtful words -- leave wounds.

It's why I am passionate about the beauty of clean source code and visual design.

It's why I'm who I am.

I suppose that might be too vague... too broad, or something like that. It doesn't even hit on the *relationship* aspect of knowing and interacting with God... but I suppose that a lot of it boils down to wanting to please Him and be more like Him.
