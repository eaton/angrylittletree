Paul Graham, genius Lisp programmer and anti-spam activist, has posted a new article on his web site... His topic? Why nerds are unpopular. There's a bit of bias in the way he approaches certain things, but a number of his observations ring true...

<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html" target="_blank">Nerds aren't the only losers in the popularity rat race. Nerds are unpopular because they're distracted. There are other kids who deliberately opt out because they're so disgusted with the whole process.</a>

In another section, he writes:

"I'm not claiming that bad schools are the whole reason kids get into trouble with drugs. After a while, drugs have their own momentum. No doubt some of the freaks ultimately used drugs to escape from other problems-- trouble at home, for example. But, in my school at least, the reason most kids started using drugs was rebellion. Fourteen year olds didn't start smoking pot because they'd heard it would help them forget their problems. They started because they wanted to join a different tribe."
