yeeeeah, that's right. the magic 8-ball says so!

*yawn* so new years was fun and i spent it in the city with the extended decapolis crew. i got a last minute invitation to a house party with a bunch of cute girls but still came to play with friends from decap. that is love! i sacrificed! perhaps i shouldn't post when I'm this tired. But all in all, a fun evening.

the gift exchange went well. somehow, i ended up with:

an octopus shaped massager

a star wars figure with removable pants

m&m's

winnie the pooh bath paints.

the bath paints come with a sign that says, 'do not disturb -- honey break!'

i think there is a theme....
