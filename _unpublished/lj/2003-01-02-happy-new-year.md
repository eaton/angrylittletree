<i>quote of the day, from julie:  "look, i don't care about work, but lunch is <b>very</b> important."</i>

so the holidays have left me pretty silent -- for some reason, my energy-to-introspect has been hovering around the 'e' mark, and my journaling has suffered for it. good stuff, bad stuff, bubbling and percolating crises, the usual stuff. Nothing crazy.

new years eve, I woke up at 11am and thanked god that I had two days off. back in the day at the <a href="http://www.willowcreek.com">wca</a>, i got the entire christmas-to-three-days-after-new-years-day stretch off in a giant chunk. this year was the next best thing, with three days off for christmas, two days back at work, a weekend, one day at work, then two more days off for new years. two more days of work after that, and bam! another weekend. it's like getting many, many weekends all packed in together. it's a system we should look into adopting year-round.

spent the morning/afternoon playing around with the dv camcorder and trying to figure out how to reliably capture video clips without actually dirtying myself with the manual. hooked up with <a href="http://fur.livejournal.com">fur</a> and did additional random vid capturing, with detours to see brenn at the <a href="http://www.gateway.com" target="_blank">gateway store</a> and munch sandwiches at <a href="http://www.panera.com" target="_blank">panera</a>. (a company that, interestingly enough, can thank <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/0,,SB1041197687392508913-search,00.html" target="_blank">life insurance policies it took out on now-dead employees</a> for almost 1/4 of its net income. i'm uncomfortable knowing that a company can profit from my death in that sort of direct and tangible fashion.)

anyhow, after some debate about whether i should be ashamed of drinking jones' fu-fu flavor soda, we bopped over to the <a href="http://www.fusioncentral.net" target="_blank">fusion</a> new years eve bash at the bowling alley. free food, lots of scrabble, and free champaign. what's not to like? as one might expect, <a href="http://fur.livejournal.com">fur</a>, <a href="http://jennafish.livejournal.com">jennafish</a>, and i were all annihilated by joannah, <a href="http://rdecker.livejournal.com">rdecker</a>'s younger sister and one of the reigning decker family scrabble champions. <a href="http://rdecker.livejournal.com">rdecker</a> herself beat me in a simultaneous second game of scrabble on my palm pilot, but the margin was razor-thin. six points! six points, i tell you!

<a href="http://danaamor.livejournal.com">danaamor</a> got a chic new olympus digicam from <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> for christmas, and she was using it to great effect -- i expect to see all sorts of fun stills up on her livejournal soon, although i also assume that all incriminating or embarassing shots of myself will be deleted before they see the light of day. i, on the other hand, will be making archival backups of my dv cam footage. <a href="http://gundi.livejournal.com">gundi</a> dancing to kool & the gang? that's not going <b>anywhere.</b>

i've come to the conclusion that people who own their own bowling balls are the bowling equivalent of the landed gentry in 1800's europe. sure, everyone is "equal..." but people with their own bowling balls are not dependent on the merciless fates of bowling-ball availability when they need to find one that fits. and, as anyone can tell you, proper heft and perfect finger-hole placement is critical to bowling well.

so, it is with great pride and joy that i announce the arrival of my new <a href="http://www.predicate.net/users/verb/lj/ball.jpg" target="_blank">dale earnheart sr. commemorative bowling ball</a>. i won it in a raffle at 11:45.

i expect my score to skyrocket.

things eventually wound down there, and a subset of the gang wandered over to a 24-hour dive near the bowling alley for munchies and conversation. i mean, it's new years eve and the alley closes at 1am. going home at that point would be like admitting that we're adults. what at the chances of <b>that</b> happening any time soon? paul, one of the newer fusion guys, brought along a friend of his who seemed deranged and witty enough to click well with us. hopefully, he'll come back and share the insanity.

(sample conversation topics included <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0090547" target="_blank">defunct 80's television shows</a>, <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Olsen,%20Mary-Kate" target="_blank">the olsen twins</a>, their <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0106763" target="_blank">dark pact with satan</a>, etc. etc. thus spoke paul's friend, who drove: "anyone who can name more than three olsen twins movies is <b>walking</b> home tonight")

<a href="http://fur.livejournal.com">fur</a> and i finally crawled back to the southern burbs at 4 or 5, parted ways and collapsed.

during the night, my laptop sucked footage off the dv cam and waited patiently 'til i awoke. when i did, a groggy <a href="http://www.mountaindew.com/" target="_blank">dew-fueled</a> editing session with <a href="http://www.sonicfoundry.com/products/showproduct.asp?PID=612" target="_blank">vegas video</a> resulted in <a href="http://www.fusioncentral.net/fusion.mov" target="_blank">this little bit of insanity</a> -- it's not for the faint of heart, humor, or patience.

while it rendered to mpeg format, <a href="http://fur.livejournal.com">fur</a> and i argued over who would drive where to see <a href="http://www.dreamworks.com/catchthem/" target="_blank">catch me if you can</a> -- a coin toss determined that i would in fact be the one commuting. the film, despite my overall loathing of mr. dicaprio, was very solid. the entire supporting cast was good, and leonardo didn't do anything to remind me of the fact that he was complicit in <a href="http://www.titanicmovie.com/" target="_blank">james cameron's turn to the dark side</a>. i want to see it again, and perhaps even own it. and perhaps take up forgery as a hobby, but only because of the inherent technical challenge. i wouldn't actually cash any of the checks. <a href="http://www.techweb.com/tech/security/20020515_security" target="_blank">i could be a white-hat forger!</a>
