<i>"The genius speaks with brilliance and charm. The apostle speaks with authority. The way of the genius is a way closed to all but a few. The way of the apsostle is a way opened to all as individuals -- even to the genius himself if he can forsake the absorbing satisfaction of a brilliant self-sufficiency and be ready to will one thing." --Douglas V. Steere</i>
