A few weeks ago, <a href="http://shig23.livejournal.com">shig23</a> and I had a discussion about the use of "private security firms," aka paid merceneries, to enforce cease-fires, participate in peacekeeping missions, etc. At the time it seemed pretty far-fetched -- a group of merceneries offered to <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/defensewrapper.jsp?PID=1051-350&CID=1051-062603A" target="_blank">keep the peace in war-torn Congo for a cool $200 million in UN funds.</a> 

Now, however, the Bush administration seems to be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/18/international/worldspecial/18SECU.html?hp" target="_blank">contemplating the move to privatized force in Iraq.</a>

<blockquote><i>"Our sense is that the military has too much on their plate right now, and that these are issues that need to be addressed, and the way to do that is through the private sector," Anne Tiedemann, an executive at the security firm Kroll Inc., told the Times. </i></blockquote>
Faaabulous.

<a href="http://www.defensetech.org/archives/000498.html" target="_blank">From DefenseTech Daily's excellent writeup</a>:

<blockquote><i>By some estimates, the ratio of private employees to U.S. soldiers operating in the Persian Gulf area is one-to-ten.
The lurch towards an outsourced police force, Singer notes, is an indicator of "how little planning the administration gave to the post-conflict stage ('don't know what to do, just give it to someone else to do')."

He adds, "How can you think that creating a new, private, paramilitary force (hired and fired by outsiders) will not cause problems with the other forces and not undermine the authority of the public Iraqi administration we are supposed to be setting up?"</i></blockquote>

This is exactly the kind of stuff that <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a>, <a href="http://hawking.livejournal.com">hawking</a> and I have been writing into the near-future theme for <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com" target="_blank">Havana Moderne</a> for years. It always seemed implausible but interesting -- an extension of the move towards outsourcing and privatization of essential services. Now that it's being seriously considered, it's kind of scary.
