US diplomat John H. Brown, who's served in London, Krakow, Kiev, Moscow, Prague and numerous other cities, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/03/10/sprj.irq.diplomat.resignation.reut/index.html">has resigned</a>. He's the second US diplomat in as many weeks to step down in protest of Bush's march towards war with Iraq.

<i>"Throughout the globe the United States is becoming associated with the unjustified use of force. The president's disregard for views in other nations, borne out by his neglect of public diplomacy, is giving birth to an anti-American century."</i>

Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/03/11/sprj.irq.fries/">US legislators take snippy potshots at countries who won't back the war effort.</a> Thanks to <a href="http://slog.livejournal.com">slog</a> for pointing this story out. Calling France a 'so-called ally'? Renaming 'french fries' to 'freedom fries' in the House of Representatives cafeteria? That's not a 'bold statement' -- it's petulant name calling, a last ditch attempt to reduce cognitive dissonance.
