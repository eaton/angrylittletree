Saw the midnight showing of 28 Days Later with <a href="http://rdecker.livejournal.com">rdecker</a>. It's not a zombie movie really -- it's more of a super-intense psyhological thriller about how people cope with the absence of civilization. Once everything is stripped down to <i>survival,</i> what will we do? The first jump-out-of-your-seat moment comes early, as the main character explores an eerily deserted downtown london, clearly evacuated on short notice. Poking around, scared, cautious, he accidentally sets off a car alarm, and <b>everyone</b> in the theater jumps and startles along with him. After that, you don't relax until it's over.

At one point, the two main characters are discussing how to stay alive after a particularly gruelling two days of hiding, running, and occasional zombie-fighting. "You need to stop thinking about whether people need you and start thinking about whether they'll slow you down," says one, "Or you'll get yourself killed." Jim -- the shell shocked, emaciated main character who woke up from a coma to discover the world  was gone -- pauses and nods. "I know. I know you think I don't, but I understand that." The underlying message, iny my opinion? Even when all the supports are kicked out. Even when everything is gone, there's something more important than mere survival.

Now, of course, I cast a critical eye towards my house, assessing it for defensability against incoming infection-ravaged zombie hordes.

Pros:<ul>
<li> Many individual rooms with doors would slow down zombies, giving critical time for escape or the establishment of a secure location. </li>
<li> Numerous blind corners for ambushes  (Also a con, if zombies have already entered) </li>
<li> Second floor has easy-to-barricade main rooms </li>
</ul> 
Cons: <ul>
<li>Lack of a working porticulis</li>
<li> Many nearby houses in subdivision could harbor zombies </li>
<li> Large bay window at ground level screams, "Please, bash through me for easy entry, zombies!" </li>
<li> Lack of long range weapons </li>
<li> Many doors and windows at ground level necessitate mutliple points of defense </li>
<li> Hallways not long enough to provide effective "Zombie Kill Zone." </li>
</ul>

I give it a Zombie Rating of 4 out of 10 -- clearly safer than sleeping outdoors, but not an effective fortress without extensive modifications.
