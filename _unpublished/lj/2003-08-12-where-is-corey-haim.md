it's amazing how easy it is to segue into psychological self-abuse when low and lonely. it takes work -- conscious, active choices about what to <i>think,</i> what to say to yourself when you're alone. i suppose that's what paul was talking about when he mentioned <i>taking every thought captive</i>. i usually think of it in a disciplinarian sense. <i>don't think about x. don't contemplate y.</i> cultivating a sense of failure around the occurence of certain thoughts or ideas.

it's when i consider that internal monologue of mine, the on-again-off-again voice of brutal self-criticism, that the concept makes sense. <i>taking every thought captive.</i> i can't keep the thought from coming. i can't prevent the comparison from being made. <i>why does 'x' happen to that person, and 'y' happen to me? what's wrong with me?</i>

but i can decide what i'm going to do once it's there.

i don't have to make the question mine. i can externalize that voice and brush those things aside. i can choose.

there's a scene near the end of <i>a beautiful mind</i> in which john nash, russel crowe's character, is talking to one of his close friends about the voices and hallucinations that accompany him on a day-to-day basis. nash, being schizophrenic, explains that he still sees them, those 'people' he once thought were part of his life but later recognized as delusional hallucionations. he explains, though, thatdoesn't have to listen to them. he can choose to ignore them, and every time it gets a bit easier.

takes work, it does. but it's a good thing.
