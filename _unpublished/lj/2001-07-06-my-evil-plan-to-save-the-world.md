Well. I've been horribly lax in my journaling over the last two days, but they've been... interesting days to say the least. After coming back from Walmart, I hung out with Brad for a couple of hours at Planet Fur. He's a really cool guy, and it's great getting more and more time to sit down and talk with him. We hit on everything from alternative religions to christian culture to shaken faith foundations to the amusing nature of emokids. But hey, when doesn't that come up? :-)

Wandered over to the Celestial Static tent and hammed it up with the gang there for a while. We came up with the idea for Ferret Shock Records, a virtual record label dedicated to hyping good pre-label bands. The whole idea was to give Label Cred without actually exchanging any money or forcing contracts. Stay intangible! It's like crossing Leggy Starlitz with selflessness. Our slogans included: "Feretshock - Cooler Than Elbel's Label," "Ferretshock - All Our Bands Get Signed By Someone Else," and "Feretshock - Because Nobody REALLY Wants To Be Indie."

Danny objected to the concept though, and we spent the next three hours having a dialectic slog through assorted interperetations of the words "Label," "Profit," "Band," and "Benefit." Mmmmm. Yummy, crunchy iron sharpening. Whee!

After that, though, we drifted off to see assorted shows and (in my case) finish A Grief Observed back at the tent. It's amazing -- a profound and moving book that should help bolster the faith of any searching, thinking, grappling Christian. Not because it offers any answers, but because it wails. It drops into the depths of grief and despair and, by so crisply, so powerfully capturing thos moments... it helps to make them less lonely, at least in some small way. An ounce of the fear any mystery is cupped out of the pool, and while it isn't enough to *change* true grief, it's enough to let you know there is a possibility of an end to it. or, as Lewis might have said, a new life after it.
 
After Soviet I buged out of the Norway^2 show and talked to Joey, Lisa, and Becky for a while. (Matt Laswell is dating Becky! Has been for a year! Dear Lord! For a year! I'm so lamentably out of the loop...)

Back at the Celestial Static tent, there was a car blocking in an SUV that had to get out to the main road. It was just a saturn, so we grabbed a couple guys off the main road and picked it up and moved it. :-) I love Cornerstone. Well. Cornerstone and cars made of plastic. At least we didn't have to move the Grand Marquis.. that sucker's solid steel. We'd have killed ourselves.

Now it's Friday and I'm chilling in the shade; after the obligatory trip to Macomb and the Yummy Happy Wonderful Showers Of Joy, I wandered the fest a bit more, hooked up with Brad, and we had another good long talk about relationships, our pasts, and the groups we identified with. Brad had the 'Church Kid Gets Sick Of It And Heads For The Wall At 90mph until he comes in contact with good folks and God gets him turned around and on fire" story, while I had the "Church Kid Goes Subversive, kicks his deck of cards down, has a year or two of deep existential angst, then God puts him back together as a postmodrnist" story. Brad Roxxors.

I hung out for a while with the RMC crew, which is always cool, although I was sad to miss the picnic. Sigh sigh sigh. It was 11:00, and I was deep in the bowels of Walmart that Thursday. Apparently about 50 people showed up.

Chuck Pearson floated the idea to me for ouremcee.com, a slashadot-meets-bloger-meets-RMC kind of site, where moderation and community karma would help eliminate the Weigel-Goat factor. It's a really sweet concept, and I'm interested in helping kick it off. Hmmmm... time to start working on web templates. Mmmm.

In the middle of our conversation though, Philmore started covering Bon Jovi's Living On A Prayer in the encore tent next door. Moral Obligation - all discussion stopped, and Chuck and I made a mad dash for the encore tent to sing along through the last couple verses and chorus. Ooooh-oooh, we're halfway there...
