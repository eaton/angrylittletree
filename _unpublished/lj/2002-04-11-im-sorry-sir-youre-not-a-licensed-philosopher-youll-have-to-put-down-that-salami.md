Starting a cool new project, back in my element: doing database design and doing architecture work for a new web-app. Rar.

After the project's client meeting, Marc and I grabbed lunch at the deli where the old Cock Robin used to be. We encountered a strange man in a black suit and a straw hat who argued with us about tautologies and foucault's Archaeology of Knowledge. He then argued that PC Paintshop Pro 6.0 was inferior to Corel Draw. And finally, he ate lunch meat with pliers.
