oldies day! oldies day! oldies day!

the collection of 60's compilation CDs and 80's pop hits that I snagged at the wheaton library turned into the soundtrack for the day; eurythmics! the bangles! the turtles! music explosion! WOO!

at one point, the song "I think we're alone now" came on. circa 1967. Tim and I turned to stare at each other, slack jawed, as the chorus kicked in. More staring.

"it... It..."

"IT WAS A COVER ALL THIS TIME!"

"Well. I think this proves conclusively that Tiffany had no talent whatsoever."
