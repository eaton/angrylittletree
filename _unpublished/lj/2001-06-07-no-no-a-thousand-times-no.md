So the <a href="http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/04/29/stinwenws02001.html">Sunday Times</a> posts more information about the sick and unholy plan to authorize sequels to CS Lewis' chronicles of narnia.

Why, I ask, must they rape and pillage our childhood memories? Or, for that matter, the best children's fantasy literature of the 20th century? Harry Potter, eat your heart out. Narnia isn't a franchise, it's a labor of love.

Leave my Aslan alone, dammit!
