As frequent readers of this journal know, the foam wars in my office can become quite heated. The weapon of choice has always been a small battery powered disc-shooter whose motor whines ominously while the attacker hides behind a cubicle wall.

This weekend, after months of neutrality, I decided it was time to level the playing field. Moments ago, the first skirmish ended with opposing parties scurrying for cover under a fearsome Nerf barrage. My Nerf-Fu is strong.
