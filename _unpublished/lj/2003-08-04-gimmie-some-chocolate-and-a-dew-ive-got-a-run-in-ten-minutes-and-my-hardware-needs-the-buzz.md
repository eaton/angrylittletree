Japanese researchers have developed a device that strips electrons from the glucose in human blood, essentially <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/03/1059849278131.html" target="_blank">converting the human bloodstream into a battery</a>. It's not a LOT of juice -- you'd use 100% of your daily caloric intake to power a 100 watt lightbulb -- but for micropowered devices like nanobots, tiny pacemakers, retinal enhancements, wireless neurotransmitters, and so on, it's the first step towards scifi style implants.

Wacky stuff, I tell you.

<a href="http://www.quietamerican.org" target="_blank">The Quiet American</a>, not to be confused with the movie of the same name, is a web site containing ambient recordings made in countries around the world Vietnamese street markets, birds singing in Fiji at sunrise, Cambodian worshippers praying at a shrine... The guy who recorded them offers the audio files as a sensory peek into other cultures, into the <i>vibe</i> rather than the <i>data.</i> Interseting stuff. Not unlike the kind of work I envision Streamers doing in <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/teaser/" target="_blank">Havana Modern's</a> future.

You know <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/105239.html" target="_blank">Flash Mobs</a> are here when the International Herald Tribune covers them.

<i>Marking Europe's growing criticism of Cuba's human rights record, the French Embassy in Havana for the first time invited several Cuban dissidents to its independence day celebrations Monday despite warnings from Fidel Castro.... The French change came after a Cuban government crackdown this spring that led to summary trials and lengthy sentences for 75 independent writers, librarians and human rights activists on the island as well as the execution of three hijackers who tried to flee the country.</i> Interesting stuff from <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/2003/07/15/news/world/americas/6304703.htm" target="_blank">The Miami Herald.</a>

UCLA researchers are launching a stunningly ambitious effort to <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=624&ncid=624&e=1&u=/ap/20030804/ap_on_sc/exp_brain_atlas" target="_blank">map the human brain</a>. Using thousands of brain scans from individuals around the world, they'er trying to map out the average sizes and functions of the various portions of the grey lump we use to think stuff up. By correlating the demographic data to the brain data, they'll attempt to figure out what portions of the brain correspond to what functions and traits. Interesting indeed...
