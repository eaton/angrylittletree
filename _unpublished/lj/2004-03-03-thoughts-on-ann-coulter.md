On Sunday, I watched The Passion of Christ. My thoughts on it are many and varied, and I'm still sorting through them. I recently stumbled across an article by columnist Ann Coulter, though. In it, she talks about people like me who believe that the film brushes past Christ's ministry and message in favor of the twelve brutal hours before his death.
<blockquote><i>"The loony-left",</i> she says, <i>"is testy with Gibson for spending so much time on Jesus' suffering and death while giving 'short shrift to Jesus' ministry and ideas'... According to liberals, the message of Jesus, which somehow Gibson missed, is something along the lines of "be nice to people" (which to them means raise taxes on the productive)."

In fact, Jesus' distinctive message was: People are sinful and need to be redeemed, and this is your lucky day because I'm here to redeem you even though you don't deserve it, and I have to get the crap kicked out of me to do it. That is the reason He is called "Christ the Redeemer" rather than "Christ the Moron Driving Around in a Volvo With a 'Be Nice to People' Bumper Sticker on It."</i></blockquote> 
I find myself marveling that Coulter is still held up by some individuals as a 'no-nonsense straight talker.' To say that the transformed Christian life, the living a life of love that Christ called us to and modeled, is simply 'being nice to people'... I suppose it betrays a fundamental ignorance of his teachings on Coulter's part. I wonder if she's read past the Sunday school pull quotes and paid attention. Is  the thumbnail sketch of Christianity she's absorbed from life in North America is just another tool in her bag of rhetorical tricks? Is a reasoned, honest discussion of the merits and importance of a particular film nothing more than an opportunity to get some digs in at The Liberals?

I find myself sad, rather than angry. I suppose if paying attention to the life Christ modeled is enough for Miss Coulter to call me a Loony Liberal, I'll accept her rebuke with honor and continue on my way.
