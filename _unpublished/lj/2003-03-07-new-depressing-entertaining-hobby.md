Reading reviews of Christian dating books on Amazon.com. Sample quotes:

<i>"As christians, we need to develop to that level of maturity Paul talks about. If we walk with Godly wisdom, I don't think we can make errors when it comes to dating."

"I HIGHLY recommend this book for every woman who ever lived, it is AWESOME!"

"I used to think this book was unrealistic, but thanks to 'A Reader', from the West Coast I was able to give life a chance . . . I accepted Jesus into my life as Lord, and finally learned to love myself."

"This book is written poorly with cliches gracing nearly every page and a significant number of generalizations are made based on the authors own experience."</i>

Every book in the category is listed at 4 stars or higher. It's like eveyone sees a book about relationships that mentions Jesus and is overwhelmed with guilt at the idea of rating it badly. Those who break ranks and say a book is dreck get berated. I <b>read</b> half of these books. The vast majority are dreck -- if you're careful and curious, you can find a few nuggets of wisdom in each one. But would the world really be changed forever if every single read <i>If Men Are Like Buses, How Do I Catch One?</i> God save us all... I hope not.
