So on a whil I started digging around and re-discovered the name of a book I'd picked up years ago, loaned to the ex, and never received back. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1890626279/qid=1048429112/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/002-8868983-0060851?v=glance&s=books" target="_blank">Politics and the Fall of Man</a> is really excellent -- a careful, scholarly look at the Right, the Left, the Center, and the fringes. Among other things, it examines how political philosophies, in their attempt for a systemic solution to humanity's problems, ultimately fail to account for the broken and twisted facets of human nature. The author, J. Budziszewski, was a vocal Nihilist political professor who ultimately converted to Christianity. His opinoins are strong, but well presented and articluately defended.

<blockquote><i>"Falleness is a paradox: We are neither simply good nor simply bad, but greated good and broken. We are not a sheer ugliness, nothing so plain, but a beauty ruined.

Numerous objections are raised to such books, hand I have heard most of them. The bluntest is that anyone who speaks of politics must impersonate an atheist. This complaint first reached me as a newly-minted scholar, just escaped from atheism myself, when a reviewer recommended against the publication of one of my early efforst on the grounds that 'God does not belong in political theory.' Paradoxically, he liked the book but objected on principle to the mention of God. There is no point in trying to reason with such people; this one went on to blame me for the massacre of the Huguenots in 1572...

"Defenses of moral evil reflect self-deception rather than real intellectual difficulties. Our main task is to remove the mask from such self-deceptions and bring to the surface what people really know. They will, of course resist. They would rather remain in denial."</i></blockquote>
He's very even-handed in his assessment of various core political views of mankind; he doesn't whip on the moral relativism of the Left without assaulting its mirror-image, the smug assurance and success-makes-right certainty of the Right.

He also argues strongly that while the Church and government certainly have overlapping concerns, Christians who feel the church should 'control politics' are treading down a very, very dangerous path.

And finally, the book offers a spectacular, fabulous index. For a relatively short work (140 pages or so) the index is extremely complete. References to all mentions of specific logical fallacies, hosts of 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th century political thinkers, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1890626279/ref=lib_rd_ss/002-8868983-0060851?v=glance&s=books&vi=slide-show#reader-link" target="_blank">all with pleasantly descriptive text.</a> It's a scholar's index. Yummy.

I just hunted around on Amazon and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author=Budziszewski%2C%20J./002-8868983-0060851" target="_blank">a number of his other books</a> look fascinating. Mmmm. New author of the month. Of course, it also resulted in the following list of drool-worthy items that I want to purchase as soon as I can justify clicking Buy Now.
