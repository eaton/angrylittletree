<a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=GHJG410XLZAMQCRBAELCFEY?type=technologyNews&storyID=2780754" target="_blank">Responding to concerns that its Total Information Awareness program would allow unfettered surveillance, the Pentagon said in a report to Congress that the program would have built-in mechanisms to ensure that it did not intrude on Americans' privacy.</a>

Well, hey. I feel safer already. Clearly, the Pentagon is the organization I want safeguarding my privacy. An old friend of mine (<a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a>'s brother) is a marine currently stationed in Baghdad. He's a good guy, compassionate as well. But he thinks the humanitarian work is a bad idea for Marines. Why? "It's like sending a blacksmith to bake bread." It could work, sure, but it's not what he should be there for. Mixing two completely separate missions is always going to mean that one is sacrificed.

In this case? I'm sure the Pentagon is filled with nice people. But I don't trust them farther than I can throw my Honda when it comes to protecting my privacy. Our government used to be big on <i>checks and balances</i>. Now we're supposed to believe that without any hard and fast rules limiting their behavior, Pentagon researchers will hold themselves back when faced with a privacy connundrum? They'll put social conscience above their perceived mission of defending the nation via deep data mining? Uh-huh. Yeah.

<a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=GHJG410XLZAMQCRBAELCFEY?type=politicsNews&storyID=2781592" target="_blank">The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed the scrapping of a decade-long ban on researching "mini-nuke" weapons, but Democrats condemned the measure which they said would spur a new arms race and heighten risks of nuclear warfare.... Rumsfeld said the administration just wanted to study these weapons, "not to develop, not to deploy, not to use" them.</a>

Uh-huh. I'm not threatening you with the pistol. I'm just studying it at you. C'mon, people. They don't want to develop them, just study them? It's not like the Department of Defense found a couple low yield nukes lying around in the alley behind the Pentagon and wants to poke around and see what they do. They want to have an ace in the hole if the next Afghanistan or Iraq gets out of hand: a nuke that sends a message with less collateral damage.

Genius. Way to start an arms race with every third world despot on the planet.
