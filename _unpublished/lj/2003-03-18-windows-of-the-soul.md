During one of my grimmer stretches (a time my family charitably refers to as 'The Dark Years') I found a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/031020397X/qid=1048017795/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-8086527-5045550?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Windows of the Soul</a>. It was good stuff. A breath of fresh air. A hint that maybe, just maybe, there were other people who saw things a bit like I did. That I wasn't alone. I present here an excerpt.

<i>The German poet Rilke tells of one of those times in a fable where the sculpting hands of Michelangelo "tore at the stone as at a grave, in which a faint dying voice is flickering. 'Michelangelo,' cried God in dread, 'who is in the stone?' Michelangelo listened; his hands were trembling. Then he answered in a muffled voice: 'Thou, my God, who else? But I cannot reach Thee.'"

We reach for God in many ways. Through our sculptures and our scriptures. Through our pictures and our prayers. Through our writing and our worship. And through them He reaches for us.

His search begins with something said. Ours begins with something heard. His begins with something shown. Ours, with something seen. Our search for God and His search for us meet at windows in our everyday experience.

These are the windows of the soul.</i>
