it's lunchtime; and so far the day is going smashingly. worked on some stuff (wow, the imac is frighteningly snappy) then sat down with Tim and David for the robis marketing brainstorming session. we hammered over things and i put forth my theory of what it is robis' key strength and selling point is: we don't just do everything. we bring that experience to even the specialized jobs. we don't suffer from 'net myopia' or anything like that.

we decided the fortune cookie thing was something great to keep going with. there's a chamber luncheon speech coming up on the 7th of october and we want to press to have some stuff done by then. (a) a postcard, full color, that has the fortune cookie on the front and a pitch on the back. then, print up the fortune cookies and give 'em out with a brochure type thing at the luncheon. david tore off a tiny sheet of paper and folded it in half at one point -- to demonstrate a brochure idea. i picked it up later and commented that i liked the size of it. it seemed friendly and approachable and somehow competent. he said something about "Well. we're not doing that." and then grinned. after a moment though he said that it would be for a pocket reference or something.

and within 5 minutes we were brainstorming for ideas: a robis pocket guide to the net. with the fortune cookie motif on the front, to keep hammering on that image/campaign recognition.

the web site is going to be redesigned... i dunno, i'm just very pumped about all the stuff that's going to be coming together about this. yay-yay.

in other interesting news, jerry called. "Oh. we're repainting the office. what color do you want?"

david asked why.

"Well. somebody came in and... kicked the walls in and smashed bottles on the walls... just trashed things, really. We're repainting it now." Blink blink blink. "It was somebody with a key, so we rekeyed the locks." the plot thickens.

alison sent me email this morning. she wants to come up and watch veggie tales. i can definitely provide videos. yay yay. she said:

"i'm gonna start getting pretty stressed soon. lots of assignments coming up which need to be done. things for TV and radio that just cannot be procrastinated with. which is all i want to do. bah. i need drive. i need ambition. i need my map laid out for me. :) i need a lot of things. i just wish i knew what i should go for..whole-heartedly...who to trust. who to vest some interest in. :) its all so tiresome. perhaps it is the late hour that causes me to wax poetic. or something." it feels like listening to myself write.

[time passes]

well, it's going on eight now and i'm plowing through yet more web page related stuff. the afternoon went kickin' rippin'ly. i'm knocking through more and more of the internet glossary, and i mentioend to dave that we would be able to turn it into a pretty cool FAQ-type document that search engines could plug into. by the end of the day there was a feeling of general enthusiasm, excitement, and momentum. it's like we're building up inertia -- and i'm pumped.

i'm giving back to the net! david was joking aroudn and mentioned we should send out bulk mail to a few million people and sell it as the ultimate beginner's guide to the net. "Only $11.99!" I started o say something serious, then blinked hard. "Get thee behind me, David!" i said loudly -- both he aqnd tim cracked up laughing.

i had my first 'iMac moment' today. i had to install the adobe bestsellers pack. i nabbed it from the shelf, walked over, and pulled out the floppies. i stood in front of my computer, holding two floppies, my brain chugging merrily in neutral while my eyes searched for a slot. "DOH!" david looked over, saw me, and laughed out loud for a full minute.

dave talked to bob saar, his friend who's the dupage county election chairman. a guy who has to juggle political crap all year to keep the elections running smoothly. dave mentioned all this stuff that's going on, and they had apparently had a chuckle about it. boba called back later, though, and asked him who the lawyer was who'd disappeared... dave answered. bob paused and said, "It's starting to make sense." another pause. "I have to go, Dave...I'll talk to you later." and hung up.

the plot thickens like spaghetti sauce.

i got the keyboard for mel, and amidst much fanfare installed it. huzzaaaahh! it didn't work. the keyboard is still malfunctioning. those, i suppose, are he breaks. $60 breaks, but breaks nonetheless.

i talked to alison tonight, ot typed more accurately. there is an echoing green concert near her, free no less! sob! it's on a MONDAY. we talked for a while though and it was good. *ponder* it was good.

got a letter from kathryn out of the blue, which was indeed quite pleasant. other news? not sure what to say. random email from interesting people, random news in the world. things happening quickly and everything rushing by -- i wish that life were simpler and alison lived five minutes away. i'd probably be out eating pancakes with her at IHOPs right now, and that thought makes me sad.
