Sigh. Back in the day I was chewing through more news and random intellectual spam than the average philosophy major. I found new topics to research just because they were there. Now, I stumble across three articles that tie right into the kind of futurism that I've been thinking about for six, seven years... and I can't help but berate myself. I <i>so</i> should've known about these stories earlier.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/04/garden/04FARM.html" target="_blank">Detroit's blighted urban wasteland is being reclaimed by nature, and the locals are helping.</a> Why fight the weeds that tear deserted concrete buildings apart? Urban farmers are making good in the deserted shell of Detroit's old manufacturing centers. Alfalfa fields, pepper farms, and more are being nursed to healthy in the concrete and glass rubble. New community connections are being forged at the same time. Who wants to bet more former industrial powerhouses will be going this way in the next decades?

<a href="http://www.tribnet.com/24hour/nation/story/1082876p-7560968c.html" target="_blank">Pittsburgh sells off city assets to stay afloat</a> -- yet another former industrial powerhouse on hard times. The interesting part is their attempt to solve the budget crisis by selling off more and more city assets. The <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com" target="_blank">Havana-Mod</a> tie-in, of course, is what would happen if a corporation or conglomerate bought up most of the city... 

<a href="http://www.accountancyage.com/News/1135797" target="_blank">"The business of the mafia is business, and there could be a lot of money to be made from malware and spamming.</a> As they consolidate control, the business of hacking and virus writing they will squeeze out independents. Spam will be an early target," says Russian virus hunter Eugene Kaspersky. "If you are a spammer or malware developer, sooner or later the mafia will come knocking on your door." I think nothing more need be said.
