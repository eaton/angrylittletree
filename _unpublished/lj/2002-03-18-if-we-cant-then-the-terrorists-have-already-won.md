I was wading through CNN archives from last year and discovered this story: <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/12/17/childsex.conference/index.html?related">Child sex trade 'a form of terrorism'</A>.

What?

Excuse me?

What strange definition of terrorism are we using that encompases child prostitution?

It disgusts me because it's another example of our global culture latching onto something that everyone agrees is bad -- Terrorism in this case -- and trying to use it as a morality-free scepter of legitimacy when condeming other things. After all, if child prostitution is <i>terrorism</i>, then everyone realizes it's wrong... No need to actually embrace any specific moral framework. Nevermind that soon we'll be calling everything from pot smoking to breach of contract 'terrorism.'

I hate child prostitution. Who doesn't? But if you couldn't explain why it was wrong before 9/11, calling it terrorism is just disingenuous.
