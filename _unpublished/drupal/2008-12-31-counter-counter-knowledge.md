Counterknowledge is a slim book about a big problem: the rising tide of pseudo-science and conspiracy-mongering that threatens to drown out real, empirical science and history in the public consciousness. It gets off to a promising start, but unfortunately it drifts for a dozen chapters before sputtering to a non-finish.

Thompson makes noises indicating that he'll address (at least in his eyes) the root causes of his rising tide. What he does is rant for a couple hundred pages about trends that annoy him: nutritionists, chiropractors, 9/11 conspiracy theorists, The Secret, and young-earth creationists -- specifically Muslim young-earth creationists. He calls these things "counterknowledge" but is admittedly dodgy about supplying rigorous criteria by which something can be labeled as such.

The result is an inconsistent, uneven selection of pet peeves united by the common thread of cultural and pseudo-intellectual contrarianism. After a few chapters, an undercurrent starts to emerge. At a dozen or so places, he characterizes the gullible vectors (or malicious originators) of counterknowledge as 'left-wing' or 'left-wing liberals.' Several times, he mentions that the problem "isn't as simple as blaming a bunch of aging hippies;" he doesn't elaborate on who else might be susceptible, though he admits that "capitalism" can sometimes encourage controversial but incorrect iconoclasts.

On closer inspection, his choice of anecdotes seem even more odd. An entire chapter is spent railing about people who think the US Government knew about the 9/11 attacks beforehand, but nothing is said about the much larger percentage of the country that still believes Iraqis were behind the terrorist attacks. An entire chapter is spent berating young-earth Creationists for ignoring scientific consensus... but no mention is made of climate change skeptics, whose minority ideas have a far greater impact on public policy.

Thompson has pet theories about why these forms of public ignorance are on the rise, and briefly explains them. Ironically, he offers no evidence and quickly dismisses alternative theories as unsatisfying: the very sin he accuses the quacks and hucksters of perpetrating. It might be that his self-proclaimed conservative Catholic capitalist (CCC?) beliefs leave him unwilling to look closely at some of his own sacred cows. Or -- even simpler -- it might just be that the book's introduction promises more than its bloggy op-ed format can deliver.
