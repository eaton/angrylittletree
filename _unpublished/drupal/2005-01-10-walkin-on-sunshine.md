Despite Friday's transportation-and-navigation debacle, Catherine and I had a wonderful weekend. More and more, we find ourselves talking for a couple of hours each time we're together, carefully navigating through relational waters that have given us trouble. There are dangers under the surface -- the sunken hulls of old relationships and the broken "lessons" we learned from them, misconceptions and hurts, the jaged reefs of stereotypes and sins and tremendously bad choices we've made in the past (and sometime seven the present). It's good, though. No excuses, but a joyful resolve to look at them with open eyes. It's good stuff -- very good. It gives me hope and it gives me courage. She's a good woman, Catherine is. And in more ways than I ever imagined, we fit together like puzzle pieces. She's a profound blessing.

Saturday we puttered around and shopped for groceries and watched movies and talked and talked and talked for hours and tinkered and had dinner and brainstormed story ideas over Italian food. She ended up crashing at my place, and Sunday morning we cruised to the Chicago Botanic Garden for a lecture on English Roses, one of Catherine's all time favorite flowers. It wes great stuff -- brought back a lot of memories for me of working with the soil, nurturing the plants, and researching creative new organic pest control techniques. I was a bit of a homebrew horticulturist in my younger years, see... Illinois' soil is hellaciously clay-filled, so you really get practice working it.

On the way home from the gardens, we spotted a bookstore sale. We being the litwhores that we are, it was a <em>moral imperative</em> to stop on. We found books that looked great, but amusingly enough she realized they were also on clearance at Barnes and Noble -- meaning that she could get employee discount if we found them there. The hunt began! Thirty minutes later we'd found copies of <em>"The Eyre Affair":amazon</em> and <em>"Lost in a Good Book":amazon</em>. How can you not love scifi set in 1984 in which the Crimean War is still going, and criminal masterminds steal living characters from the pages of classic novels, where crafty detectives must rescue them? And <em>Catherine</em> found them. My Catherine! She found good scifi! I'm so proud. I think I could cry.

In other news, I sneakily caught a picture of her while she was making her way through the gardens. She's beautiful, shockingly so.
