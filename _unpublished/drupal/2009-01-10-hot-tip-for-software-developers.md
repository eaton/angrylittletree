First, do not use Internet Explorer 6. If you have customers who use Internet Explorer 6, pull out your checkbook and give them $50. Tell them to start using IE7 or Firefox. This will be much less frustrating and far less expensive than trying to make IE6 happy.

Second, when testing a music download system that automatically starts songs in iTunes, choose your test data carefully. @webchick has a folder full of test files, all of which are duplicates of a New Kids On The Block song. I think it's pushing her towards madness. Me? I'm using a couple dozen copies of Jump Around. I thought it was a good idea when I started, but man... that opening hit on the horns is really starting to burn itself into my brain.

Third, yes. The <a href="http://www.aerobie.com/Products/aeropress_story.htm">Aeropress</a> is the best and most delicious piece of coffee gadgetry <em>ever.</em> Catherine found it on the web and grabbed one for me this Christmas, and I've been blissing out on smooth, low-acid coffee with yummy flavor ever since. There are good reviews elsewhere online so I won't waste time writing one up, but I can't recommend it enough. It's awesome. I have to go, now, and drink more coffee.
