I'm lounging in my sun-dappled living room, enjoying an exquisite salami-swiss-and-bacon-on-rye sandwich. 2006 was a pretty great year, all things considered. Catherine and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary, and married life agrees with both of us quite well. I met up my old friend Nate for the first time in years; I learned that good things may change and evolve, but they stay good things. I'm lucky to know him. One of my closest friends broke The Baby Barrier, being the first in my crowd to become a daddy. It's crazy realizing that I'm years older than my parents were when they had me (I'm nearly thirty! Awk), but they say that forty is the new thirty these days. So I should be safe.

I made the jump from Drupal Hacker to Drupal Hardcore Geek, diving into core development and -- ultimately -- landing a new job. Now I work from home, doing something I love with a team of people that any developer would be envious to work with. It's cool stuff. I've been living in a new place for more than a year now, and learning that I <i>love</i> the city of Batavia and the area around it. Thanks to the magic of The Internets, we could happily live almost anywhere at this point.

I made no progress on my long-running, long-suffering <i>One Hundred Words</i> project, but I feel less guilt about it. In 2007, I want to dive and and get more accomplished (as does Jason). I feel less panic about it, though; I know that I have a lot of irons in the fire and I don't have to worry that I'm a failure if I don't pound out new script revisions or storyboards.

A good year, 2006. I'm looking forward to 2007.
