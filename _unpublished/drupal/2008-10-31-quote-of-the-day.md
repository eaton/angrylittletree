Thomas Fleming of Chronicles Magazine is one of those awesome curmudgeons who dislikes pretty much everyone. He's so conservative that he only grudgingly supported Reagan, so you can imagine how thrilled he is about a potential Obama victory.

<a href="http://www.chroniclesmagazine.org/?p=763">No, wait, you probably can't imagine.</a>

<blockquote>[Obama] is an enemy of anything good that has ever been done in this country or this civilization, and when he is elected, I hope that all those Silicon Valley libertarians who supported him will live to see their property confiscated and their kids sent to reeducation camps.... Where is Willie Horton when you need him?</blockquote>

Sliced bread? Obama hates it.

The number zero? Yep. Hates it.

Electric lights? You don't even <em>want</em> to know what he said about <em>them.</em>
