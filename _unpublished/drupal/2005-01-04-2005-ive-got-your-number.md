Most of the link sites are buzzing about the latest article from Edge magazine. They asked over a hundred scientists and public figures in the science world to answer a simple question: "<a href="http://www.edge.org/q2005/q05_print.html" target="_blank">What do you believe is true, even though you can't prove it?</a>" The answers are a wild and crazy peek inside the thoughts of those whose work normally demands precision and provability. One researcher boiled it down to the elemental: "I believe that the natural world is consistent and can be understood." Being willing to admit that the basis of his research was a <em>belief</em> was pretty refreshing. Of course, one of the reductionist biology wanks took the opportunity to talk about beliefs <em>other</em> people hold and can't prove, contrasting them to his own objectivity. But that just proves that biological reductionists are wankers.

Had my first appointment with the therapist yesterday, and it was good. I think I amused him by coming in with four pages of densely packed notes in outline form with a separate bullet-list of Goals And Expectations. But hey, if I'm paying $150 an hour for this guy's time, I'm not going to waste it hemming and hawing. All joking aside, I was freaked out and shaky through the whole thing. It was good, and I know that I'll be able to work with him. It's just scary. Journey into the unknown and all that. Rah.

Tuned into the oldies station on the way home, and a couple of songs drifted by.

<strong>Georgie Girl, by The Seekers</strong>

Hey there Georgie girl,
why do all the boys just pass you by,
could it be you just don't try,
or is it the clothes you wear?

You're always window-shopping,
but never stopping to buy,
come shake those downy feathers and try,

a little bit,

Hey there Georgie girl,
there's another Georgie deep inside,
bring out all the love you hide,
you can't always run away,

Don't be so scared of changing,
and rearranging yourself,
it's time for jumping down from the shelf,

and you'll be
a new Georgie girl,
wake up Georgie girl.

<strong>Live for Today, by The Grass Roots</strong>
When I think of all the worries people seem to find
And how they're in a hurry to complicate their mind
By chasing after money and dreams that can't come true
I'm glad that we are different, we've better things to do
May others plan their future, I'm busy lovin' you

Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today
And don't worry 'bout tomorrow, hey, hey, hey
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today
     Live for today

We were never meant to worry the way that people do
And I don't need to hurry as long as I'm with you
We'll take it nice and easy and use my simple plan
You'll be my lovin' woman, I'll be your lovin' man
We'll take the most from living, have pleasure while we can

Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today
And don't worry 'bout tomorrow, hey, hey, hey
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today
     Live for today

My lesson for the day? The sixties were <em>fucked up.</em>
