Or, rather, <em>A Discourse On Movie Adaptations of Childhood Favorites.</em> Last week, Cathereine and I saw <em>An Unfortunate Series of Events</em> after work. The series is easily among my favorite childrens' books, alongside  <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/074594776X/viapositiva-20">Brown-Ears</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0064471195/viapositiva-20">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>. It's jam-packed with puns and sly literary in-jokes, it's untainted by Harry Potteresque moral utilitarianism, and it's deliciously dark without being evil. So when <a href="vhttp://ae.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ui/mercurynews/movie.html?id=205818&reviewId=16873&1c" target="_blank">The San Jose Mercury News gave it a so-so review</a>, I was concerned. The review's a fun read in and of itself, a tribute to the style of the books, but it raises the sorts of concerns that are faced by any fans when judging a movie adaptation.

How faithful is "faithful?" Should a screenwriter, or a director, feel free to adapt and massage a beloved book to work with a new medium? <a href="http://www.lordoftherings.net/">The Lord of the Rings</a> trilogy strikes me as a great example of an adaptation, faithful to the things that made the books what they were without bogging down. That didn't satisfy some fans, though, who were enraged by subtle and not-so subtle changes. Were they right? I don't think so, but I didn't have much emotion invested in the three-part structure of <em>The Two Towers</em>. I read the series when I was 14, and even I bogged down in the long sections. I loved the story, but my young ADHD-addled heart longed heretic-style for a "Good Parts" version.

After seeing it, both Catherine and I <em>did</em> enjoy the movie a lot. It shuffled around quite a few of the book's events, invented a few, and left out some of the choice jokes. That's okay, though. Even if they didn't keep the choice joke about the Virginia Wolfsnake, a reptile that should never be allowed near a typewriter, the movie was true to the spirit of the books. It delighted in the same dark absurdity and language-play that made the books fun. Jim Carey was a caricature, but Count Olaf was a caricature in the books -- we're not exactly talking about <em>Rainman</em>, here. So, yes, I liked it.

The upcoming version of <em><a href="http://www.narnia.com/" target="_blank">The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe</a></em> on the other hand... <em>that</em> fills my heart with fear. Disney, people. <em>DISNEY!</em> I'll be watching them like a hawk, I tell you. At least <a href="http://bvbp-qt.vitalstream.com/LionWitchWardrobe/LionWitchWardrobe_BehindMagic_1500.mov" target="_blank">the recently posted technical SFX preview</a> looks promising. They may yet jack up the story, but at least the minotaurs look good.
