The rumors are true. I've gone over to the dark side. While this site -- jeff.viapositiva.net -- is still running Drupal until I can migrate all the content, I'll be moving over to a new streamlined blog over the next few weeks. That blog will be running WordPress.

Why? Have I abandoned Drupal? Of course not. I spend a lot of time working with Drupal -- building sites with it, helping clients figure out solutions to esoteric problems, writing new tools for other developers... It's easy, though, to get tunnel vision. When I joined the Drupal community a little over four years ago, I was an outsider. I'd been working on Windows software for years, and had spent time with tools like DotNetNuke, Rainbow, Xoops, Movable Type, and TikiWiki. Drupal's approach to solving problems like <em>organizing content</em> was a breath of fresh air. After some time juggling multiple CMS platforms, I made the 100% switch and never looked back.

During the first couple of years of my involvement in the project, I drilled deeper and deeper, submitting patches for modules and then Drupal core itself. Eventually I was rewriting key pieces of the core software itself and working closely with the Drupal ninjas who'd started the project. It's pretty thrilling to get involved, become knowledgable, and have an actual hand in shaping a tool that you love to use.

So, why the switch on my blog? Two reasons. Simply put, the Drupal community's biggest weakness is its insularity. The folks who are most knowledgable about Drupal, and spend the most time building and enhancing it, are the <em>least</em> involved in other projects, the <em>least</em> likely to be getting first-hand experience working with other tools like Wordpress, Django, Joomla!, Ning, and so on. There are exceptions to that, of course, and even a degree of tunnel vision isn't unique to Drupal. Matt Mullenweg of Wordpress fame isn't spending his days cruising the CCK issue queue, after all.

But as we look to build and improve Drupal, it's critically important that we keep our field of vision wide. When we talk about improving the Drupal administrative user experience, are we carefully studying other tools' solutions to the same problems? Are we just skimming screenshots and feature lists, or are we using those tools and becoming familiar with how they <em>work</em> in addition to how they <em>look?</em>

Beyond the goal of improving Drupal, there's a second reason. It's easy to allow my familiarity with the platform to blind me to better solutions; after all, I'm the guy who cloned <a href="http://www.blittr.com">Twitter in Drupal</a> just to show it could be done. The fact that a Drupal expert <em>can</em> do something with Drupal doesn't mean that they should, however. Forcing Drupal into tasks it's not well suited for is like using a Swiss Army Knife to cook breakfast -- it demonstrates flexibility, yes, but it's also pretty frustrating. If my goal is to blog, quickly and simply, why not use WordPress? It's designed specifically for that task, and it does a great job.

Over the next few weeks, as I embark on my migration, I'll be posting more about my thoughts and experiences with the new platform. It should be quite the adventure!
