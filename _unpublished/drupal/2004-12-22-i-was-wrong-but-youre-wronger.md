William Saffire <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/12/22/opinion/edsafire.html" target="_blank">kicks off his latest NYT editorial</a> with a startling revelation:
<blockquote>I now admit to having expected the war in Iraq to be won in a matter of months, not years. Saddam Hussein's plan to disperse his forces and conduct a murderous insurgency, abetted by his terrorist allies, was a surprise.</blockquote>

The "Wow, we were all shocked when it didn't work out" meme is wishful thinking, not unlike the "Everyone thought he had WMD" meme <a href="http://www.blogd.com/archives/000732.html" target="_blank">deftly debunked by Luis of The Blog From Another Dimension</a>. The insurgency <em>did</em> come as a shock to those who believed Sadaam would helpfully fight a stand-up ground war, lose, and leave the country in the hands of a suddenly robust pro-US democratic government. Those factions did exist -- they wanted to install dubious Iraqi expats like Chalabi as leaders and enjoy the pro-US parades that would doubtless spring up around the countryside. At least <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/19/news/intel.html" target="_blank">CIA plans to seed the country with US flags before the invasion</a> were scuttled at the last minute, thank God.

The point, though, is that <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/540967.html" target="_blank">lots of people</a> were <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-10-24-insurgence-intel_x.htm" target="_blank">warning the administration</a> that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/09/29/iraq.intel/" target="_blank">things would go this way</a> long <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/540967.html" target="_blank">before it happened</a>. People like Saffire were dismissing them as naysayers reliving Vietnam, but the ignored warnings turned out to be very very important. Saffire may be shocked that he was wrong now, but when he says that it was "a surprise" he can't mean that no one had ever brought up the possibility.

Of course, in the next paragraph he doubles back and sets up a new rhetorical foxhole: <em>we were still doing the right thing!</em>
<blockquote>This by no means suggests that President George W. Bush's decision to overthrow a dangerous despotism was a mistake. On the contrary, it was and is the right war (against a genocidal maniac who was gaining strength) in the right place (the Middle East cradle of terror) for the right purpose (to get the Arab street out of the rut of hatred and onto a path to freedom).
.
In return for today's grudging concession of tactical misjudgment, however, I claim this expectation: When and if we Americans discover hidden supplies of germ weapons in Iraq or Syria, and as future confessions reveal the extent of connections between Al Qaeda and Saddam, the legion of war critics will forthrightly admit their certitude was misplaced.</blockquote>

Perhaps yes, perhaps no. The idea that the war as it is currently being conducted will "get the Arab street out of the rut of hatred" is a bit suspect, given the news of the day. I'll grant him that one, though -- who knows how things could pan out? The interesting bit is that he's focusing on germ weapons and hypothetical connections to Al Qaeda as the proof we must wait for. The myth of 'huge weapons stockpiles' and 'Al Qaeda connections' have <em>also</em> crashed against the rocky shore of reality in the past year. The fact that terrorists have now flooded into Iraq to fight our troops doesn't erase the fact that <em>Sadaam</em> never worked with them. At what point will Saffire be satisfied? I hope he's not advocating an eternal intelligence war, driven by the obsessive need to validate past decisions. That would be kind of depressing, neh?

In all seriousness, I believe Iraq is in dire straits. It was in dire straits before we got there, but it was also stable. Iraqis have gone from frying pan to fire, and regional stability is getting worse rather than improving. Bringing peace and freedom to oppressed people, and defending our country, <em>are</em> worthy goals. But they're worth doing truthfully, transparently, and humbly -- with a keen eye on our own limitations as people and as a nation. We can't force another country to like us, and it's even more difficult when we're bombing them on a regular basis. Admitting mistakes and attempting to get help patching them up, while impossibly silly in the world of politics, seems like the only way to really salvage things.
