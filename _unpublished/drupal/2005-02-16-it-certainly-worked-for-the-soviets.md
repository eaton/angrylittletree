<a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=domesticNews&storyID=7653566">An interesting article comes down the pipeline from Reuters</a> -- apparently, the new CIA Director Porter Gross hasn't been reading his talking points. He came out and admitted that the conflict in Iraq is serving as a training ground for the next generation of urban combat terrorists.

<blockquote>"The Iraq conflict, while not a cause of extremism, has become a cause for extremists," Goss told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

"Those jihadists who survive will leave Iraq experienced in and focused on acts of urban terrorism. They represent a potential pool of contacts to build transnational terrorist cells, groups and networks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries," he said. </blockquote>

This is what quite a few observers have been noting for years. It's a contrast to the 'Flypaper Effect' theory that's been floated by various pro-war commentators and bloggers, a view that presupposes a finite number of terrorists in the universe. Even Tom Clancy's war-porn novels talk about the natural selection of combat: If you throw a thousand tough guys into combat with AK-47s, you'll end up with 20 very competent survivors. If you resupply the ranks and continue the process, natural selection will produce a hardened guerrilla force in short order. By US estimates, <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7374-1425022,00.html">there are 200,000 militants</a> currently in Iraq fighting US forces -- that leaves a lot of room to thin the herd.

It's one of the reasons that combating underlying causes of terrorism (far more than just 'the need for elections' and 'hope' and 'freedom') is essential. If the region keeps producing ideologues and terrorists, if our actions keep giving recruiting fuel to those ideologues, and ongoing combat weeds out the incompetent guys from the mix, we could turn Iraq into a top-notch commando school for the terrorists of the next 30 years. Fun, fun fun. Snarkism aside, Gross' statements are encouraging. At least on this point, he understands one of the key realities. 

One of his comments, though, is a tricky one. <em>"The Iraq conflict, while not a cause of extremism, has become a cause for extremists."</em> What does that mean? From his comments, I think he's getting at the idea that deadly flavors of religious extremism are not caused by things like the US invasion/liberation/occupation/caretaking/whatever of Iraq, but that such things become very powerful issues for extremists to rally around. In addition, such events can help extremists recruit moderates and 'fence-sitters' to their camps.

Recent CIA studies have attempted to profile the motivations and psychologies of Iraqi insurgents. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1508-2005Feb5.html">A WaPo article</a> hits on important points:

<blockquote> "This person, with a tribal background, has a mix of motives including a family grievance, someone was hurt by coalition forces," said the official, who asked not to be identified because the reports are still classified. "There is also [in this Iraqi insurgent] religion and nationalism that results in a view he must fight on to get non-Muslims out of Muslim territory."

In looking in depth at one insurgent, the agency was able to describe the group to which the fighter belongs and how it operates, the official said.

The CIA last month also updated its analysis of the breadth of the Iraqi insurgency, including Iraqis that are not only former Baathists, "dead enders," but also newly radicalized Sunni Iraqis, nationalists offended by the occupying force and others disenchanted by the economic turmoil and destruction caused by the fighting. </blockquote>

Trying to figure out ways to prevent that, trying to search for solutions to the threat of terrorism that don't give the extremists even more ammunition... those approaches are often called 'capitulation' or 'surrender' in today's political climate. That's absurd, and dangerous. I've yet to hear anyone on the right or left in our country suggest that terrorism is something that is <em>good</em>, or that terrorists <em>should be allowed to carry out their plans</em>. Those paths would be surrender. Those paths would be monstrously, depressingly cowardly. But suggesting that we should proceed with caution, that we should respect a terribly complex social-political-religious matrix as we wade into 'fixing things' is not surrender. It's <em>refusing to be stupid</em>. When differing ideas about 'best practices' emerge, that's a good thing. These days, though, it's treated as <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/pressingissues_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000743012">a step toward treason</a>. Sigh.
