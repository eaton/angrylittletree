I've taken the plunge and upgraded the blog to Drupal HEAD in anticipation of the eventual 4.7 code freeze. HEAD is feeling stable enough right now that I can use it without too much stress. In addition, I wanted to get a start on converting my awTags stuff to Drupal's new free-tagging taxonomies. To that end, I whipped up the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/39822">related_nodes module</a>, which exposes a sidebar block listing nodes similar to the current one. It's based on the awTags code for a similar sidebar block, but It uses taxonomy terms rather than special tags. Most sites will be able tosee it populated without any additional work, and it's a bit more customizable.

There are still a few hitches for the site (I'm getting a lot of referrer errors in the site logs, though I don't see any problems on the pages, for example). But overall, I'm very happy with the experience.
