After over a year of development, <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-4.7.0">Drupal 4.7 is finally out the door</a>. Woo! I started poking around in the Drupal world during the 4.5 days, and I saw (from a distance) the release of 4.6. As I've learned more about the system and become more involved in the community, I've realized what a significant milestone 4.7 really is. A few of the improvements that have really excited me include:

<ul><li>Much improved installation process for third-party modules (copy the files over, enable them in the control panel, and they install themselves)</li><li>A tremendously powerful API for creating and rendering forms, the meat-and-potatos of the web app world. This part of the 4.7 upgrade is one of the reasons it took much longer than expected, but the wait is worth it.</li>

<li>PHPTemplate, a powerful and robust theming engine, is now part of the Drupal core</li>

<li>Numerous performance improvements in areas like caching, path aliasing, and so on</li></ul>

Work on 4.8 is just beginning, and the general consensus in the development community is that it should focus on polishing and refining the Drupal user experience, particular for administration tasks. 4.7 provides a host of new tools we can use to that end, and the next several months should be very exciting.

Congratulations, everyone!
