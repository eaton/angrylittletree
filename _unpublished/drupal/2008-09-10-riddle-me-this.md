I've been curious about something ever since Palin's remarkable convention speech. When Bush was elected in 2000, I and many other members of my church supported him primarily because of the promise of 'compassionate conservatism.' The idea that local groups, charities, and volunteers could make a difference in their communities, and that empowering government officials was the Wrong Way To Solve Problems, resonated deeply.

Eight years later, I'm struck by the fact that a man who decided to delay law school and work for a Catholic inner-city charity for three years -- the very model that we wanted to applaud in 2000 -- is openly mocked by conservative leaders specifically for doing those things. The party is explicitly attacking the very things that they said were fundamental American values just two elections ago.

I don't want to put words in anyone's mouth, and I don't want to assume anything, but... I'm utterly, completely at a loss. How can this possibly be resolved?
