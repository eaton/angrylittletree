Okay, so the last couple of posts have been somewhat heated. On advice from Ajax and @amystephen I took a break, breathed slowly, wrote some Drupal code, and watched some TV.

Thankfully, BBC America is ready to help. After watching an hour or so of Primeval and Being Human, I have to say -- Britain's crap scifi is so much better than our crap scifi, it's not even <em>funny.</em>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/arts/television/24human.html?_r=1&ref=arts">![](/files/being-human.jpg)</a>

Being Human is basically a cross between True Blood and Coupling: two buddies and the cute girl share a flat and have wacky (and dramatic!) adventures. One of the guys is a werewolf, another is a vampire, and the girl is a ghost. It makes for some awkward situations with the landlord, and some super-drama-filled relationship problems. "No! I love you! I just... really... had to leave last night! The moon, see..."

I approve.

Thank you, BBC America.
