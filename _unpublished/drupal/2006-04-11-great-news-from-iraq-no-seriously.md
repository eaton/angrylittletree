The latest stats indicate that US military casualties are down on all fronts -- not just the one-step-forward one-step-back shifts in casualty numbers we've seen before. <a href="http://www.opinionatedb@stard.com/archives/000731.html">Opinionated Bastard</a> runs the numbers and puts out some pretty charts, though I'm not sure I agree with all of his assumptions (what 'woundings vs killings' means about the type of combat, for example).<br/><br/>It's not all perfect -- civilian casualties are still distressingly high,and overall us military injuries overall are still trending upwards. We don't know what that means precisely, as 'woundings' covers everything from a guy losing all four limbs but being medvac'd to a hospital, to someone getting grazed by a bullet during a capture. But fewer US soldiers dying is always good news.
