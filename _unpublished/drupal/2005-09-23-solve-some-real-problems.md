Via <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/substitute">Conrad</a>, a <a href="http://www.zenarchery.com/full-text-of-the-grim-meathook-future-thing">spot-on essay</a> from ZenArchery.com.

<blockquote>Meanwhile, most of the people with any genuine opportunity or ability to effect global change are too busy patting each other on the back at conventions and blue-skying goofy social networking tools that are essentially useless to 95% of the world’s population, who live within fifteen feet of everyone they’ve ever known and have no need to track their fuck buddies with GPS systems.</blockquote>

I couldn't have said it better myself. Even forward-looking folks like the guys at WorldChanging tend to get sidetracked on cool shiny ecotech. There's nothing bad about it, but a lot of it focuses on allowing us to maintain a high standard of living -- not lifting others up.
