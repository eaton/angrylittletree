<strong><a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/">Obsidian Wings</a></strong> is the gold standard of hobbyist political blogging. Formed years ago by a conservative who was interested in building dialogue across ideological and party lines, it's evolved into a place where four or five regular posters from various areas of expertise discuss social, economic, and political issues with a depth and a thoughtfulness rarely witnessed in today's media environment. The founder ended up leaving for RedState.com, a more traditional partisan blog, and the commentariat skews leftward now. Still, several of the of the conservative posters remain and top-notch content from writers like Hilzoy, Publius, von, and others makes it a daily must-read.

<strong><a href="http://karenmcgrane.com/">Karen McGrane</a></strong> is an awesome information architect from Bond Art & Science, a web team in New York that's designed sweet stuff like the Fast Company and New York Times sites. I've had the pleasure of working with her on the <a href="http://buzzr.com">Buzzr</a> project: her blog's fascinating posts about content strategy and information management only scratch the surface of her talents.

<strong><a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/">Brand New</a></strong> is a fascinating design blog that covers brand/logo redesigns. If you've ever wanted to listen in as designers deconstruct the color scheme for Tropicana's new packaging, this is the place to do it. You'll learn a lot, and hear all kinds of fun inside-baseball rumors about different design firms and personalities in the world of high end identity/brand building.

<strong><a href="http://ta-nehisicoates.theatlantic.com/">Ta-Nehisi Coates</a></strong> is one of The Atlantic's house bloggers, and his writing is definitely worth a read. Comic book news? Check. Insightful, genuinely moving posts on racial and cultural issues? Check. A willingness to change his mind over time? Also, check. I've only been following him for a week or two based on a link from MeFi, but he's fast becoming one of my go-tos.

<strong><a href="http://bibigreycat.blogspot.com/">Agence eureka</a></strong> is a super-focused blog that firehoses cute French ephemera and papercraft. 1950s postcards, alphabet books, paper dolls... All there. Even better, the posts link through to high-resolution Flickr images for the obsessive readers.

<strong><a href="http://www.amconmag.com/larison/">Eunomia</a></strong>, the blog of Daniel Larison, is a voice in the wilderness at the moment. Larison, an Eastern Orthodox Christian, challenges liberal policy positions advanced by the Obama administration, <em>and</em> the intellectual and philosophical bankruptcy of the modern Republican/conservative movement. While I disagree with some of his fundamental positions, he never resorts to the destructive invective that has done so much damage to our culture. He's whip-smart: wonk-heads ignore him at their peril.

<strong><a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/">Whatever</a></strong> is the blog of John Scalzi, writer of numerous fun and semi-pulpy scifi novels. I've been reading his blog long enough that I forgot I read his books first: he's smart, entertaining, and rarely gets sucked into ugly flamewars about current events. Recently he's also been interviewing other authors and pointing out great stuff going on elsewhere in the fantasy/scifi world. Without Scalzi's blogging, I'd have never heard about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Monster-Lee-Martinez/dp/0316041262">Monster</a>, and that would've been a tragedy.
