When Jonah Goldberg and Glenn Greenwald agree on something, chances are it's worth paying attention. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/mccains-fall-a-warning-t_b_56291.html">Arianna Huffington's latest column</a> lays the blame for McCain's imploding campaign at the feet of his Iraq war policy -- more precisely, his support for the President's policies. Both Glenn and Jonah, not known for agreeing on matters Iraqi, fired off responses almost immediately. See if you can guess who's talking in each of these quotes...

<blockquote><a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2007/07/16/mccain/index.html">...The opposite is true: no presidential candidate can possibly hope to win the GOP nomination unless he... supports the war in Iraq.</a></blockquote>

<blockquote><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YmRlOTY2MDNlN2M3MDU0YWU3M2ViNjk5OWI0ZjBhNmI=">...All of the punditry — save Huffington's — argues that McCain has no choice to become a single-issue win-in-Iraq candidate if he wants to save his campaign.</a></blockquote>
