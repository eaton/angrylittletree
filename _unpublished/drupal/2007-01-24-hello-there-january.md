Despite my promises to blog more regularly, the trip to Providence for the Lullabot Workshops knocked me off my rhythm. They were great fun, though, and it was a real pleasure to work on distilling Drupal's ins and outs for an audience of curious web developers. I got a chance to meet the rest of the 'Bots, including Angie and Ted and Nate and Liza and Robert and Jeff and Matt (in no particular order). Angie and I confirmed that we're the Doublemint Twins of the Drupal world, sufficiently geeky to pass up <i>free drinks</i> in favor of hacking on core.

There were other thrills, too -- one of the guys who wrote the web design classic <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creating-Killer-Web-Sites-Third-Generation/dp/product-description/1568302894">Creating Killer Web Sites</a></i> was there attending the workshop. I went a little fanboy, admitting that it had been my personal HTML bible in the heady days of the mid-90s, when spacer GIFs were cutting edge and tables were advanced page layout tools.

Getting home was really, really nice. I forget sometimes how much time Catherine and I spend hanging out together, and I missed her a lot. Abby, too, was missed though it was nice not having to sticky-brush myself free of fur every twenty minutes or so.

In other news, I obtained (wait for it, this one's worth it) <i>A Nintendo Wii.</i> Against all odds, a GameStop about 5 miles from home had a few in stock and I was there at the right time. Finding a second remote for it is proving to be even more difficult, but Catherine and I are quite enjoying the Tennis and Baseball and classic Zelda (on the virtual console). Nintendo <i>knows how these things are done</i>, friends. I popped in an SD card and realized that it had a pile of old honeymoon photos. How? The Wii popped up a nice slideshow with friendly background music and spiffy transition effects. Not only that, it displays my blog site perfectly. Hooray, Wii Internet Browser!
