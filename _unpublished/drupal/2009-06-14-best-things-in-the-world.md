<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.freakangels.com">FreakAngels</a>, an episodic webcomic by Warren Ellis and artist Paul Duffield. It's free to read online. It's stupidly high-quality. It's in print on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freakangels-1-HC-Warren-Ellis/dp/1592910572">Amazon.com</a>. If you like good graphic novels you owe it to yourself to read this, and the archives are now deep enough that you can sit down for a few hours and get up to speed.</li>

<li>The <a href="http://960.gs">960.gs</a> grid system. I'm fine with code and I can think in grids, but working out all the krunky stuff to make a complex layout work in IE, Firefox, and the rest? That feels like pain. The 960 grid sacrifices some semantics and locks you into a static layout, but it means you can work fast and focus on results. I'm hooked.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.magichat.net/">Magic Hat.</a> I've never seen it around before, but they've got it freakin' <em>everywhere</em> here in Providence. Yum.</li>

<li>$99 iPhones. I guess that's the last of my excuses, once August rolls around and the end of my Sprint plan comes up.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeffeaton/sets/72157619610494247/">The MIT Museum</a>. @mettamatt and I saw robots and sculptures and old hand-wired LISP machines, and it was <em>crazy.</em> I want to be a mechanical engineer when I grow up, and I have a new and profound respect for electrical engineers, the tribe my dad comes from. They had to make their 64K of RAM out of a washing machine full of copper wire, and they <em>liked it.</em></li>

<li>The glorious and gorgeous <a href="http://restlessviolet.com">Catherine</a>. I love traveling and hanging out with the Lullabots and the rest of the Drupal world, but coming home and seeing her after a week on the road is a wonderful thing. Hooray for home!</li>
