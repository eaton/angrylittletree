For the past month or so I've been picking through <I><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0801441145/002-3825322-1486418" target="_blank">Corporate Warriors</a></I>, a fascinating book about the privatization of war. Increasingly, outside security contractors are being leveraged by the Pentagon during wars and regional conflicts to handle logistics and even combat. The book explores the history of the practice, the ebb and flow of skilled merceneries vs. standing armies. (Interesting trivia -- the word 'freelancer' descends from the "Free companies" of Lance-carrying merceneries that Switzerland exported around Europe centuries ago.) 

It's been fascinating reading, and very sobering. I had no idea that Dick Cheney's friends from Haliburton were the ones who helped execute the US Military's plans in Bosnia... It's all played in with the plans <a href="http://hawking.livejournal.com">hawking</a>, <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> and I have for <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com" target="_blank">Havana Mod</a>. Back in '97 or so we were predicting that this would happen -- little did we know that it <i>was</i> happening at the time.

Now, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1103566,00.html" target="_blank">a recent Guardian article</a> drills into this phenomenon in Iraq. Apparently, "private corporations... are the second biggest contributor to coalition forces in Iraq after the Pentagon." There are now over 10,000 private military contractors now on the ground in Iraq.

Not too much else to say about that, but it's certainly food for thought. How far will subcontracting go?

In other news, <a href="http://news.biocompare.com/newsstory.asp?id=21554" target="_blank">it looks like stress can keep you healthy.</a> Just call me superman, baby.
