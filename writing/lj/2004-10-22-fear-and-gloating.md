<a href="http://hawking.livejournal.com">hawking</a> and <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> and I are always talking about how scary and prescient some of the Havana Moderne stuff is. It's kind of a joke, but every few months something like this pops up and gives us the willies.

<a href="http://predicate.livejournal.com/281092.html">March 25th, 2004, this journal:</a>
<blockquote>2026 - Koushudoumei conglomerate with strong presence in Europe and South America concludes initial primate test-phase, replacing portions of spider monkey brains with neural gelpacks programmed to mimic outputs of the 'original' portions. Medical applications for those with damaged portions of the brain are obvious.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Professor Theodore W. Berger, director of the Center for Neural Engineering at the University of Southern California, is creating a silicon chip implant that mimics the hippocampus, an area of the brain known for creating memories. If successful, the artificial brain prosthesis could replace its biological counterpart, enabling people who suffer from memory disorders to regain the ability to store new memories...

If everything goes well, they anticipate seeing an artificial human hippocampus, potentially usable for a variety of clinical disorders, in 15 years.</blockquote>
