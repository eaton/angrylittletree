Those who know me know I'm a news addict. I suck up a lot of random information every morning, and I start getting antsy if there isn't a clear, unobstructed pipe of news attached directly to my cranium. Without further ado, the current stories in each tab of my 'News' window:

<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99996465">Rough ride won't stop next X Prize shot</a> -- the latest news from private spaceflight team dedicated to doing what NASA did decades ago, without government support.

<a href="http://www2.lhric.org/pocantico/rollman/00/nshowto.htm">How To Make A Grilled Cheese Sandwich</a> -- by Nicole. She and a bunch of other elementary students put together ISO-like manuals for common kid tasks. Fun stuff.

<a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/541286.html">Tall, Blond, and Danish?</a> -- As it turns out, Denmark has a tidy little business going in the <i>sperm supply industry.</i> I'll never look at Scandanavian culture in the same way again. Reminds me of <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/23/1093246439231.html?oneclick=true">the millionaire who tried to build a "Nobel Class Sperm Bank"</a> decades back, amidst accusations of racism and eugenics.

<a href="http://www.nti.org/d_newswire/issues/2004_9_29.html#F8775458">U.S. Missile Defense Can be Fooled by Decoys, Documents Say</a> -- This is what happens when you let engineers write documents instead of your marketing guys. You know. Revealing actual <i>problems</i> with brittle, overhyped systems.

<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/20040930/od_nm/life_bear_dc_4&cid=573">Bear Ransacks Kitchen as Paralyzed Man Lies in Bed</a> -- No comment needed, really.

<a href="http://news.biocompare.com/newsstory.asp?id=52444">Researchers Find Allergy-Free Soybean</a> -- Plant geneticists brute-force the search for an allergy-friendly bean.

<a href="http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20040930.html">Demagoguery emboldened: Attacks on dissent since 9/11</a> -- We must kill democracy to save it. If you disagree, the terrorists have won! Or... something. Right? Right?

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/09/30/iraq.main/index.html">Baghdad car bombings kill 45</a> -- Now, even Rumsfeld admits things are getting worse.

<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/evote/0,2645,65120,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2">Diebold Rep Now Runs Elections</a> -- An influential employee of voting machine maker Diebold Election Systems left the company recently to take a job as elections manager for a California county. Greaaaaaaaaaaaaaat.

<a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2107100/">The Cult of Che: Don't Applaud The Motorcycle Diaries</a> -- I've been a Cubaphile for a long time, and this article nails it. Somehow, Che Guevera morphed from cold-blooded-marxist-soldier to sensitive-man-of-the-people in the American memespace. He was fascinating, that's for sure, but the revolutionary-t-shirt set seems to be ignorant of the really, really, really dark legacy he left in Central America.

<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200409u/int2004-09-20">A Tragedy of Errors</a> -- An in-depth interview with James Fallows regarding the Bush Administration's decision to pursue war, and the process that led to it. Interesting stuff.

<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/09/30/debate/index.html">Fact-checking Bush</a> -- Salon's predictable but interesting take on the upcoming debates.
