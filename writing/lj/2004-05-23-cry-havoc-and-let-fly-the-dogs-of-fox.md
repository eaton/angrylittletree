Wow.

I've never actually watched Fox News before -- only heard about it and read the occasional transcript. While scaring up some breakfast this morning I left the TV on Fox as an experiment. It was... mind-boggling.

Choice lines include: "As if we needed another reason to hate the French -- they like Michael Moore! If they were hoping to repair their damaged relations with us, they've just shoved a big stinky wheel of brie in the works. Congratulations on your little movie, Mike. Now, come home and get a <i>fair and balanced</i> opinion of it."

Also, watch and giggle as Newt Gingrich defends Ahmed Chalabi, Fox commentators suggest that Bill Tenet is smearing Chalabi to cover his own ass, and Chalabi is described as "An Iraqi businessman who studied mathematics in the US." I'm very amused that the 'Chalabi Fast Facts' didn't mention  that he all but crashed the Jordanian economy with a baroque embezzling scheme that destroyed one of the country's largest banks, and has received millions of dollars from the US government to feed us false intel data. They <i>did</i> mention that he founded the Bank of Petra, but failed to mention that he was convicted of embezzling millions of dollars form it and fleeing the country when the government caught on. What I'm curious is, now that the US government doesn't play with Chalabi anymore, why isn't Fox News on-message?

The crowning moment was the interview with Kerry and Bush's campaign advisors. The anchor interrupted Kerry's advisor to support Bush's position several times, and the crowning moment of the interview was the Bush advisor's assertation that "Kerry is running a political campaign during a war -- you want us to fail!" The anchor interjects to tell Kerry's advisor, "Well, there certainly are quite a few people who think that's what Kerry wants..."

I'm just boggling. It's like an opinion echo chamber, that channel. "As if we needed another reason to hate the French?"

it's the embodiment of all the stupid jokes I thought Liberals used as straw men to discredit thinking conservatives.
