<blockquote><i>A woman collapsed in an East Wichita theatre this morning, during a showing of "The Passion Of The Christ". Peggy Law apparently suffered a heart attack. She was pronounced dead a short time later at a Wichita medical center....

People viewing the movie at the Warren Theatre East say Law collapsed during the portion of the movie where the crucifixion of Christ was shown.

A few off-duty doctors and nurses who were in the audience tried to revive her. But when she was taken away in the ambulance, authorities say Law still had no pulse.</i></blockquote>
I'll be seeing the film on Sunday; I'm still not sure what to think of it. I'm less concerned about the film itself than the message it sends about the Church. Were <i>any</i> other film to center around two hours of shockingly brutal torture and violence, we'd be holding it up as an example of our society's descent into ruin and debauchery. Artistic merit and important messages wouldn't be considered -- we'd mark the film as inexcusable, and demand (as many did with The Passion) that it be given the NC-17 kiss of death. If a kid <i>died</i> in the theater of a heart attack at a key moment, we'd be calling congresscritters demanding it be banned for the safety of the children.

But because it's about Jesus, the rules change.

I don't know what the film's content is, yet. I've read reviews, I'll be seeing it in a few days. I don't believe, though, that an emotionally shaking experience is synonymous with an <i>important</i> or <i>positive</i>experience. The church has called this film one of the most powerful evangelism opportunities in 2000 years. Hype aside, I pray it's not just a chance to show the world we think <i>our</i> selnseless violence, brutality, and traumatizing gore is better than <i>theirs</i> because <i>ours</i> is about <i>Jesus.</i>
