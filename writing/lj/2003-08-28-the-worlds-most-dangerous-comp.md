Those who know me know that I make comp CDs. It's not a hobby, it's just a side effect of being alive. I exhale carbon dioxide, I make comps. That's the way it is.

Now, there are good comps and there are sublime comps. And then, every once in a while, there are comps that cause <a href="http://js0n.livejournal.com">js0n</a> and I to turn, stare at each other, and nod in silent approval.
