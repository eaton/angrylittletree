apple officially announced system 8.5 today, and the numbers on teh iMac are in -- only 55% existing mac owners! the rest of the sales are split up between new computer buyers and winFolk.

went to the GOA meeting and schmoozed randomly -- Tim and I were trapped by The Amway Guy Who Would Not Take A Hint. Older fellow with greying hair and a manager's face. "My son in law was the one who discovered it, he sold his medical practice and does this full-time, now!" he said with platinum card enthusiasm. "I'm very status oriented," he assured, pegging us as money-hungry go-getters. hah! if we were money-hungry we wouldn't be at robis! eat that, dude.

i evaded him by giving him my card. but it was really david's. hahah! the speaker was a REALLY energetic guy that david and tim said was an older version of me. like, 30 years older. same mannerisms and verbal habits ("Um. nevermind..") he talked about sociological changes! GPS systems! the 'net! woo wooo!

other work included pleasant tweaks to the PFS main page (I'm rather proud of myself for those!) and misc. improvements. we muuust get those finished, then get stones up, then do kirkby... and then work on other projects.... oif. it gets overwhelming sometimes.

trying to ignore the relationship thing, unsuccessfully. as i said to mom once, "Hah! My Cloak of Cynicism is the perfect fear-repellant! If you're pessimistic enough, fear just walks up, blinks at you, and walks away."

went to the COD library and got my library card. read the economist. it's strange; it FEELS like 'college kids' should be older than me, but now most of them are younger. something's so very wrong about that.

badly named product of the year: "potato bootie."
