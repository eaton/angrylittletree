just for the record, i hate waking up after dreams about her.

it's not that i want them to stay -- it's that i can't forget them for so long. they cling like a wispy second skin, like cobwebs you walk through and just can't shake. this one was different, though. more vivid.

she showed up at my door like nothing had happened, and like a fool it let her in. we talked and i tried to ask her what had happened, but i was an idiot and i thought she had returned For Real. Before I had worked up the nerve to ask her the hard questions she left, walked out the door, and told me she was staying at a hotel. To visit her.

So I did. When I rode the elevator up, walked to her room, and opened the door, someone I didn't know jumped out of a corner and clubbed me with something heavy. Beat the crap out of me, and I woke up.

hi again, people. long time no see.

i thought the journal could use some activity.

any tips on how to handle someone who's obviously willing to forget you at the drop of a hat? the mind is easy, the heart less so.

i don't like feeling like such a mess.

in better news, the felonous deejay is gone, the company folded, the road trip was a success, and the new job is great. further bulletins as events warrant or discussion dictates. talk amongst yourselves.
