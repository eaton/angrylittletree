Synesthesia has always fascinated me. Like radio cross-talk between the human sesnse, it mixes colors with tastes and shapes with sounds and sounds with numbers and so on. Years ago, researchers decided it was genetic -- passed on the X chromosome -- but further research is beginning to hint that it might be a dormant capability in all humans, unlocked but not <i>caused</i> by certain genetic triggers. <a href="http://feed.proteinos.com/002226.html">Protein Feed</a> has more info, and some links to other interesting articles on the topic.

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/08/27/jaw.transplant.ap/index.html">British doctors grow a replacement jawbone in a man's back muscles.</a> Using stem cells. I... yeah. I have no comment. Technically cool but circus-freak <i>strange</i>. This is the feeling I got reading Neuromancer for the first time in 1989 or so. I was late to the game, but it still felt straaaaaaaaaaaange.

This story's been making the rounds and probably isn't news to any of the other current events hounds I know, but yeesh. Margaret Thatcher's son! Accused of trying to stage a coup! Wacky. Very wacky.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/26/education/26bully.html">The New York Times has an interesting article about "cyberbullies"</a> -- kids who take real-life bullying to the 'net with IMs, blogs, email, text messages, and so on. The idea is that parents always worry about protecting kids from stalky scary adults, but a new generation of bullies are using network tools to harass their peers. What's interesting about this is how different it is from my experiences as a young scrawny kid discovering BBS's and the internet. In a world of words, I felt empowered -- even when others harangued me. I've always assumed that the net offered more possibilities for creative field-leveling as well.
