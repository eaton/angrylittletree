So it's 6:15 and I'm starting to feel human again, something that was definitely in question after last night. New Years Eve never seems to measure up to the deleriously cool visions of sparkling parties and balloon drops and midnight kisses that movies give to us. Instead, it manages to knock the hell out of you and leave you wishing you had gotten its license number before it speeds off into the distance.

I came to at 12:20, having missed the true millenial turnover while nursing my headache; huddled in one of Jason's beanbags while Jess and Danny cuddled on the couch. Heated discussion ensued to decide whether we should make it to a show or just sleep more. Both Fur and I slept more, by default. AFter groggy deliberation, Jess and Danny's departure, and a shouting match between Jason and Mandie, we all hit the road. Fur and I took my car while everyone else piled into the Jasonmobile. The bands were good -- including an unexpected two-song interlude by a band we made fun of until they lashed into a sweet industrial-with-keyboards-and-good-harmonies set.

Post-show we drifted back to the house of Juli and Randy, the lead singer and bassist for one of the earlier bands. Watched Weird Al DVDs, played with Christmas gifts, and underwent the bizarre hand-mousturization-treatment ritual of dipping our hands in molten parafin wax.

It's so strange... moreso than last New years. The 1900s are dead, long live The Bomb. It spawned atomic weapons, the computer, the microcomputer, the palmtop, and the imbedded under-the-skin tracking device. It chewed up kingdomes and spat out low-intensity regional ethnic wars. It offered us Y2K and the biggerst anticlimax in history. But come Jan 1st, 2001, it's mundane. Even the last technical vestiges of the 20th century are wiped clean, and it's business as usual in the 21st.

This morning, after coming to at Julie and Randy's house, the rest of the gang sprawled groggily around the living room, we drove home. Fur and I were too tired to repeat the previous night's introspective conversation, preferring grunts and warnings about upcoming stop signs. Dropped her off at Jason's, and made my way to Dunkin Donuts where I ate cruelers and read Zeitgeist by Bruce Sterling. The strange feeling of having pushed through a wall onto the other side of some important transition washed over me; it was a fitting way to kick off the year, probably aided by sleep deprivation and too much linguistic theory.

And then...

I slept.
