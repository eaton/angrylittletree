the holidays took a chomp from my routine, chewed ten times, and swallowed. Hopefully, with Kirkby & Associates banished to the pit from whence they came, things will begin to calm down again. Yay!

So. The rundown of Christmas '98. Last minute shopping and halfhearted tinkering with Windows 95 consumed some of the early hours, and the lazy-relaxed atmosphere did recuperative wonders. Christmas eve saw the Living Water candlelight service... the revelation that Susan Harp likely has MS... and the delivery of a box of veggiestuff from jason.

surfing before i collapsed to bed on christmas eve, i bumped into beck on instant messenger. we talked, shooting the breeze for a while before i asked her how things were going at MCF. not well, as it turns out. she's having a lot of trouble penetrating the 'everyone knows everyone' field that exists around the otherwise wonderful church. for someone like beck, who's been so 'plugged in'... I can only imagine the difficulty coming into a new world like that.

christmas day -- PRESENTS! Oi oi oi! Mom opened hers -- a journal, lined in red velvet and bark paper. The paper, the card, all especially selected for that gift. It was perfect, and I couldn't keep down the grin as she opened it. i talked to jason soon after the present-opening was done; with my yoyo in hand, and round-the-worlds scaring the daylights out of other family members, i told him how things were going and he reciprocated.

that evening, jason and i hooked up for the night and proceeded to thrash each other to bloody little bits in marathon infinity. oh, the joy, the bliss of powermacs on ethernet! dawn called, having tracked him down while she was in peoria... overhearing their conversation was a little strange, as he reassured her that he wasn't having too much fun in her absence. the more i see of dawn and jason together, the more... needy dawn seems. jason too in some ways -- aren't we all? -- but so many times it seems that dawn is there wanting jason to be everything for her, and wanting to be everything for jason in return. even to the point of feeling threatened if he is not forlorn in her absence. But I digress.

saturday was consumed by an ill-fated attempt at shopping the sales -- good heavens! borders was a MADHOUSE. bodies packed into isles like literary cattle.

i fled home, redhat 5.2 and 'DNS for NT' under my arm, and spent the rest of the day lounging, talking to mom and dad, and flailing wildly at Xfree86.
