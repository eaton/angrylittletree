I've been reading, in my copious spare time, an excellent book titled <i>War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning,</i> by Chris Hedges. A former seminary student turned photojournalist, he spent years in international hot spots like Serbia, Sudan, and Central America. He writes eloquently and passionately about the horrors of war and, more importantly, the seductive purpose-giving power of conflict. His premise is a complex one not suited to sound bytes or slogans, but he sums it up well in the introduction:
<blockquote><i>I wrote this book not to dissuade us from war but to understand it. It is especially important that we, who wield such massive force across the globe, see within ourselves the seeds of our own obliteration. We must guard against the myth of war and the drug of war that can, together, render us as blind and callous as some of those we battle....
The only antidote to ward off self-destruction and the indiscriminate use of force is humility and, ultimately, compassion. Reinhold Niehbur aptly reminded us that we must all act and then ask forgiveness. This book is not a call for inaction. It is a call for repentance.</i></blockquote>
I'm only a third or so through it, but it's terribly good. Pick it up.
