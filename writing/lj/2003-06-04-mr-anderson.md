Talk about a well-played game of scrabble. <a href="http://rdecker.livejournal.com">rdecker</a> just placed her last tiles in an epic match that played out like a scrabble adaptation of Neo's battle with Agent Smith. (The one in the subway station from the first movie, that is.) The terminally curious can view <a href="http://thepixiepit.co.uk/cgi-bin/scrab/p2/r7/crossword.pl?board=rachel_and_otra" target="_blank">the aftermath here.</a>

In other news, <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> just walked in from his meeting with the <i>best summary ever.</i>
<blockquote>"It's very sobering when you walk into a meeting with a three-page spec written by your CEO, put it in front of him, and he sits for two minutes staring at it, silent... then murmurs, shaking his head, 'Son of a <i>bitch</i>...'"</blockquote>
