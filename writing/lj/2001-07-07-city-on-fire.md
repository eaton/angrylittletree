There's heat, and there's cornerstone heat. Heat makes you hot. It leaves you sweaty, leaves you thinking, 'Wow. I could use a cold drink or a fan.' Cornerstone heat makes you want to end it all by diving into a vat of dry ice. It sucks youe will to move, shakes your will to exist, and leaves you slow-roasting in a puddle of your own moisture. We've had heat all week -- this morning, the Cornerstone Heat arrived.

We all made it to the dorms -- Jason included -- and got the requisite showers. By the time we arrived back, Mister Sun was an angry, angry sun indeed. Much stumbling around in brain-numbing heart ensued, and at one point I wandered back to the campsite to find Fur locked in her truck, the air conditioning running full blast. She let me in and we listened to Ember Swift in a blissy daze, soaking up every moment of delicious COOL. Siri poked her head in and joined the party; eventually we dragged outselves back into the heat to see Beck's hardcore band Elemental play. Zounds! Our little becky's grown up, and she's all badass hardcore. Jason and I were so proud.

The heat didn't let up -- evil evil thing that it was. The trek over to the Echoing Green show was worth it, though... RMC showed up and Joey played a magnificent set with full equipment and sound and Good Yummy Crunchy Bass. We danced. In the heat. In the dirt. I ground a six inch whole in the dirt with my dancing and soaked myself with sweat -- every time a new song kicked in, everyone grabbed thmselves and threw their bodies into pogoing and dancing that SHOULD have been impossible. We were Joey-Powered. :-)  He finished up with the Safety Dance and cheers of 'We Love You Joey!'

And then I stumbled out of the tent and collapsed at the Celestial Static tent because I was dead. I poured water on myself, fanned myself, and after thirty minutes of lying prone declared myself ready to stumble back to my car and turn on the AC.

I woke up in my car two hours later with a splitting headache, and dragged myself to the Decap stage. Thank God -- I slept through the Breaking Of The Heat! We now have plain old garden variety heat without the evil malevolent intelligence guiding its every sunbeam. Yay!

The exodus is starting in full force, as people who don't want to stay to hear Stryper or Starflyer pack up theircamps and make tracks for home -- or at least get ready to bold tomorrow morning. Scary -- I'm already thinking about Cornerstone 2002 plans. I forgot how much I've missed it. ;-)
