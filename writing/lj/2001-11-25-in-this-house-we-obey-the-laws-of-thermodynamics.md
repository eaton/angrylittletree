so, geek that i am, i'm testing out palmpilot submission of my lj entry. hung out with the old v6 crew last night, which was cool. had good italian food as we waited for everyone to gather, then headed downtown to chill at a mellow theme-bar called the samba room. i approve. nursed cokes and limes while random bois plied the girls' favor with attempts at suave banter. eventually jason and i peeled them off of elisa and we made our stylish exit.
