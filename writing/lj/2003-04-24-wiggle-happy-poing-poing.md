In news unrealted to weird body image issues, <a href="http://gundi.livejournal.com">gundi</a> also loaned me a copy of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0310238382/002-8542606-1896021?v=glance&me=ATVPDKIKX0DER&st=books" target="_blank">Finding Faith,</a></i> a book from my Amazon wish list that looks like it's right up my alley. An excerpt from a review found on Amazon reads:

<i>"McLaren is brutally honest about the fact that when most non-Christians look at what Christians are like, what they see tends to repulse them. Too often we Christians present our worst face to the world: our bigotry, our arrogance, our legalism, our lack of cultural and social sensitivity, our tacky art, kitsch merchandise, and bad music, our lack of philosophical depth or intellectual nuance, our sexual or financial scandals, our abortion clinic bombers, our homophobic preachers, our aggressive culture wars and paranoid right-wing conservativism, and worst of all, our lack of visible unity and our inability to even love one another as Christ commanded....
"Can you think of any good reason why a decent, thoughtful, non-Christian person would want to risk taking on all that ugly baggage and even begin exploring Christianity? Well, Brian McLaren recognizes this huge risk that spiritual seekers take when approaching Christianity, and he has aimed 'Finding Faith' at providing them with reasons to give Christian faith a second chance."</i>

Mmm. Yummy.
