<b><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/05/18/MN251738.DTL">Pentagon can't account for $1,000,000,000,000.</a></b>
<i>Though Defense has long been notorious for waste, recent government reports suggest the Pentagon's money management woes have reached astronomical proportions. A study by the Defense Department's inspector general found that the Pentagon couldn't properly account for more than a trillion dollars in monies spent. A GAO report found Defense inventory systems so lax that the U.S. Army lost track of 56 airplanes, 32 tanks, and 36 Javelin missile command launch-units.</i>

I'm at a loss for words. Enron is a rounding error in this debacle. Read the story for interesting bits about the attempts to "reform" -- I had no idea that the Defense Department has failed its past 7 audits by the government's General Accounting Office.
