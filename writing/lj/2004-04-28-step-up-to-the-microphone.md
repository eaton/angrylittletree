It's been too long, chillens. I'm back, and  there's too much going on in the world not to rant and rave. The news tour this week yields a treasure trove of interesting stuff, so it's my duty to summarize.

<a href="http://www.back-to-iraq.com/" target="_blank">Back-To-Iraq</a>
Christopher Allbritton is a former AP wire correspondant and a writer for the New York Daily News. He's now independent, a free-roaming journalistic entity who makes trips to Iraq and digs for interesting stories. He's reader-supported. Drop some PayPal cash in the coffer, and he's your own personal man on the front. "You can also ask me to check out stories you're interested in," he said in an email when I fired off payment. "I won't be able to check everything out, and I'll not do anything overtly stupid, but I'll do my best..." <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/100-1/" target="_blank">Havana-style</a> media streamers. Independent investigative reporters. It's coming, people. Give it ten years.

Access networks springing up in all kinds of places... free feeds, 24/7 connections... We really have to get issue #2 out the door fast, or people will start thinking we're making a <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com/100-1/" target="_blank">documentary.</a>

Good friends told me about this site a while back, but I've rediscovered it and will claim that it's new and cool. Piles of free and legal MP3s from known artists like Amon Tobin, Arab Strab, and others less visible. Thousands of songs available for download, with an ultra-swank <a href="http://www.epitonic.com/radio.jsp" target="_blank">dial-a-genre streaming radio</a> feature. I love it.

Have I mentioned how much ass Defensetech kicks? Lots of it. Solid coverage of military-industrial complex news, from people who aren't trying to beat swords into plowshares but aren't afraid to call stupid moves what they are. Recent stories include news about experimental <a href="http://www.rdecom.army.mil/rdemagazine/200402/itl_arl_liquidarmor.html" target="_blank">gel-based body armor</a>,  the ongoing "<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4825948/" target="_blank">armorgate</a>" <a href="http://www.defensetech.org/archives/000781.html" target="_blank">controversy in Iraq</a>,  and <a href="http://www.defensetech.org/archives/000880.html" target="_blank">insightful metacommentary</a>.

More music. This one's a daily blog updated by some cool, tasteful soul whose name I haven't bothered to learn yet. Every morning there's a link to a new single on the fringes of visiblity. Lately, the blog has focused on strangely chopped up mixes with a hiphop cover feel. The remixed/chopped version of The Clash's London Calling is quelle chic, including a nice cut by Felix Da Housecat.

Nightline, apparently, is dedicating Friday's installment to reading the names and showing the photographs of the 500+ soldiers who've died in combat in Iraq over the past year. Considering the administration's mostly successful work to keep U.S. casualties out of the public headspace, it's an impressive move. Go Koppel.

<i>"It took thousands of years to make the Neolithic transformation from hunting and gathering to modern agriculture," notes Cliff Goudey, director of MIT's Center for Fisheries Engineering Research. The transition to open-ocean aquaculture, though, will have to take place within a few decades. "If it doesn't happen," he says, "I'm afraid we'll destroy the seas."</i>
