<i>"I remember the things that she said about me when we were dating -- the compliments. The things she said she admired or appreciated about me. When we broke up, I saw how those same compliments and assessments were shifted over to the someone else. Even when it required a 180 degree reversal of how she'd described him when we were dating. It taught me a valuable lesson. A compliment from someone who is interested in you doesn't say anything about <b>you</b>. It only reveals what qualities the person values, and the fact that they are currently happy with you. When they cease to be happy with you, they will begin describing other people as posessing those valued qualities, rather than you. Until you realize that, you'll leave every relationship asking yourself, 'What was wrong with me? What changed?'"</i>
