So last night at 9:30 or so the pager went off and <a href="http://blaster151.livejournal.com">blaster151</a> and I cruised over to work. Something had crashed at the client site, the email said, and we needed to fix it -- pronto. Six hours later, all was well and it was beddy-bye slumpy-slumpy time. Today I'm dragging like nobody's business. I'm not twenty anmore, apparently, and I can't get by on this little sleep while maintaining productivity. Yarr!

In better news, apparently <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/20/iraq.main/index.html" target="_blank">we finally put the smack down on Chalabi, the ultra-huckster who's been feeding the US government bad Iraqi data since the mid 90's.</a> Apparently emergency revisionism is already kicking in, though. According to the CNN story, <i>"CPA spokesman Dan Senor only noted that Chalabi 'worked closely with us over a number of months.'"</i> Just a tad bit of an understatement, considering he was the man the neocons wnated to <i>put in power</i> in Iraq until very recently. Chalabi was the source of most of the tremendously bad intel that came to the government leading up to the war, and was on bad terms with most of the intelligence community by that time. It's sad that we kept him on the payroll for so long. Imagine the schools we could've refurbished with that $300,000 a month...
