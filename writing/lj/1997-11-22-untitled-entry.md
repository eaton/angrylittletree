i'm in the driveway of grandpa's house, in the dark, mel on my lap. mom is scared... grandpa's memory has been getting worse and worse over the past several weeks, his coherence. he'll come to the door without clothes on, or not remember how to start the truck... things like that. but other times he'll be perfectly lucid. as good as I am when i'm thinking about something. she's scared, because she doesn't know if she'll ever see him alive again, and doesn't know if he's been saved yet. as we were driving away, halfway down the street, she stopped us. a short conversation followed, in which she admitted she was afraid.. theat she'd never see him again, that she'd bear the burden of not having said anything... of not knowing... for the rest of her life.

i know what she means. sucks some serious shit being on the wrong end ot that equation. i think back to milisia, the things that happened then. was I writing then? I don't think so. but it hit like a fist. only, what, three days earlier? i had talked to her... could i have said something? should I have? i know i could've... but she said it was months, not days... never trust that. someone else was typing for her... reading to her. God, why? why didn't I say something? anything?

i don't know.
