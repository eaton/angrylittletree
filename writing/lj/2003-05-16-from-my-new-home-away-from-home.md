A few weeks back I was invited by an old friend to contribute to <a href="http://kingdomcome.blogspot.com/" target="_new">Kingdom Come.</a> A small but cool blog, it's the observations and conversations of a group of Christians about various wacky aspects of the Church and Christian life. I was asked to post an introduction there, and discovered that it's horrendously difficult to summarize the key events in my own life. Especially ones that relate to my beliefs. For those who are interested, here's a repost of my introduction...

<!--break-->My name is Jeff Eaton, and I'm the new arrival Adam's earlier post alluded to. The last couple of weeks have been a whirlwind of job transition and other business, and now that things have settled down I'm excited by the prospect of diving in with Kingdom Come.

Introductions are tough (it's always difficult to summarize yourself), but I'll see what I can do. I'm a twenty-five year old software developer, amateur photographer, freelance writer, and armchair philosopher. The only child of an engineer and an artist, I think I've grown into a bit of a mutant whose interests and passions straddle the left and right hemispheres. I was raised in a Christian home, and while I'm grateful for the heritage that's given me, I think there's a special set of challenges for those who grew up in the subculture of the western Church.

Through my teens I developed into a rabid apologist -- a big fan of books like <I>Evidence That Demands A Verdict</I>, <I>The Case For Christ</I>, and so on, I wanted to prove to others that my beliefs were correct. While I genuinely cared for many of the people I discussed matters of faith with, I now realize that my motivations were mixed. While I wanted to show others the truth of the Gospel, I was more interested in proving to <I>myself</I> that I was correct. The more people I could convince, the more rhetorically skilled I could become in my defense, the easier it was for me to ignore the nagging issue of <I>faith</I>

As I entered the workforce and began interacting with a more diverse group of people, I found that the pillars of my faith were shaken. I met sincere, genuine individuals who had honestly examined the Scriptures and come to the conclusion that they were simply Interesting Stories. While I clearly disagreed with them, their reasoning was just as internally consistent as my own.

The resulting examination of my own beliefs (and reasons for believing) were the start of four years of grim soul-searching. I had spent my life trying to sharpen my mind to fend off doubt. Now, I was discovering that my reason was simply a tool for defending beliefs that I couldn't explain. It was a scary time.

In retrospect, I believe God was busily knocking down the foundations I'd built on sand in my own life. Could I bring myself to "check my brains at the door" to resolve the conflict? I didn't think so, and left me anchorless. Slowly but surely, through books, the work of close friends, and wacky coincidences, He was showing me that faith is far more than "certainty in something invisible."

Today, I'm helping a group of friends organize and run a small Bible Study/blossoming house church in the Chicago area. The best explaination I can offer for my transition comes from Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.: "I wouldn't give a fig for the simplicity on this side of complexity; But I would give my life for the simplicity on the other side of complexity." I'm trying to learn, trying to grow, and trusting God: even when I'm off by a mile in my understanding or my actions, He's faithful to hold me up and show the way.

Wow. That was <i>spammy...</i>
