I'm not trained in formal logic, and I haven't spent much time hammering through this, but a discussion about the legality of various universally reviled forms of expression (say, hardcore porn depicting non-consenting partners -- something no one is willing to argue is *good*, but some will argue is *permissable*) got me thinking about the fact that we often equate 'having the right to do x' with 'x being the right thing to do.' Someone went so far as to say that thoughts on morality should not enter into public discourse, since they are inherently subjective, whereas rights are definable and clear.

it concerned me for some reason that I couldn't articulate, and the following is my attempt to hammer out why. feel free to jump in, disagree, and/or point out flaws. i'm trying to work through this conceptually, not prove a point.

Premise: Moral frameworks exist as both voluntary exercises and externally enforced Laws. 'Rights' are Meta-Laws used in a pluralistic society to determine which moral guidelines are acceptable for inclusion in externally-enforced Law.

(1) Postmodern culture, in the absence of an overarching moral framework, has settled on 'rights' as the standard of human behavior. i.e., "Do you have the right to do that?" is asked rather than, "Is that the right thing to do?"

(2) In theory, this protects all members of a pluralistic society. Because they most likely disagree on what behaviors are morally acceptable, 'rights' establish a universal framework of what can and cannot be punished, regardless of individual moral conviction. In theory, this prevents one group from punishing other groups for violating its moral framework.

(3) It has also become commonplace to dismiss any and all discussion of 'moral rightness' when analyzing complex issues outside of the fields of science and medical research.

(4) When the addition of new Rights is debated, the single greatest consideration is the possible damage done to other Rights.

(5) In light of items 2-4, it is reasonable to say that 'Rights' have become a defacto moral framework. Unfortunately, since 'Rights' exist as a compromise between competing frameworks, there are many, many Rights that are almost universally regarded as Morally Wrong. Lying for personal gain is a Right in many cases, but few would argue that it is Morally Correct.

(6) As Rights become the defacto moral framework of postmodern culture, exercising a Right becomes a Good thing. Thus, moral frameworks that assert the moral wrongness of a given Right are in conflict with the culture, even if they do not attempt to remove the Right.

(7) This undermines the primary purpose of a Right as a mechanism for compromise.

Conclusion: There is a grave danger posed in viewing Rights as a free-standing moral framework. Instead, they should be viewed as a compromise to mediate interactions between competing moral frameworks.
