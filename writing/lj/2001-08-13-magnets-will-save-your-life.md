so my new office is really really cool -- plenty of space, a window, and thanks to <a href="http://www.ikea.com">IKEA</a>, it's well-lit with pleasant incandescent goodness! Saturday and Sunday were relatively uneventful -- I hit <a href="http://www.generationaxis.com">Axis</a> and caught up with Paul Prather Saturday night, which was a LOT of fun. I haven't talked to him in ages, since I left the <a href="http://www.willowcreek.com">WCA</a>, and it was really cool to touch base again. We're planning to grab dinner after work sometime and see what fun and odd stuff has been happening in our respective worlds. Hung out with Danny and Jess until around 1am, watching <a href="http://www.scifi.com/mst3000/">MST3K<a/> and playing Kengo, then spend Sunday lounging and browsing the mall.

All in all, relaxing stuff. Good recuperative time.

This morning I got to work, started plugging away at <a href="http://www.codeguru.com/">code</a> and other <a href="http://www.nerf.com">fun stuff</a>. Looks like they might be dissolving my team and rolling it into another one on our project that's desperate to ship on time. It makes sense, but it's still disappointing. I'll be working on mods to old architecture rather than building new stuff the way I am on the current team. Such is life, I suppose.

Composed random stuff with the <a href="http://www.magneticpoetry.com/">magnetic poetry<a/> on my file cabinet during lunch:

you could heal that mess
and change her broken laugh
she said
you could make her smile your masterpiece
if you would only see

do you know how hard it is to find the word 'ONLY' in a pile of magnetic words? Egad.

Oh, yes. I forgot. <a href="http://www.neocron.com">Neocron</a>. See it. Love it. Taste it. Caress its texturemaps lovingly. Hold and cherish its stats system.

That's right, kids. It's a hard cyberpunk massively multiplayer online RPG. Put in your request for vacation days now -- it ships Q4 2000.
