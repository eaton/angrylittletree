Apparently Dr. Neil Clark Warren, noted Christian author and relationship expert, felt the need to send me email today.

<i>Dear Jeff,</i> he said to me. <i>I want to take a moment and write you about recent events at eHarmony. As often happens in life, we've recently experienced some of our most successful and challenging days simultaneously.</i>

<i>I've asked our staff to come up with a way that I might show our appreciation for your loyalty and perseverance during this exciting and trying time. This offer will allow you to use eHarmony at a substantial discount for several months for a limited time.</i>

<i>Until midnight on March 31st, 2003 we're offering 12 Months of eHarmony service for the price of $100.00. That's a $150 savings. The details of this offer are below.</i>

Well then.

I know <i>I'm</i> flattered by his offer.
