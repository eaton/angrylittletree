I think we all know that the Patriot Act sucks dead monkey skulls. Yes? Yes. The problem is, what to do about it? After you've written to your congresscritter, written to the local paper, and posted vigorously on a variety of weblogs, what's next?

Support the ACLU's new campaign to publicise the dangers of the act. The real problem, as I see it, is that the majority of Americans don't realize the mind-boggling badness of the Act, and its impact on personal freedom, privacy, and basic constitutional rights like due process, etc.
