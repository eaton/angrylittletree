<i>We're at war with Islam.</i>

It's been said a million times in a million different ways in the years since 9/11. Not at first, of course -- in the last few months of 2001, even most of the rabid Samuel P. Huntington fans were willing to say that not <i>all</i> Muslims were terrorists.

Slowly, though, that even-handedness has bled out of most discourse. It's easy to find a pundit, a friend, even a general or a politician talking about terrorism in <i>us vs. them</i> <i>Islam vs. the West</i> terms. While most admit that there are 'good Muslims' out there, it seems to be viewed as an inevitability that Islamic Culture is incapable of change, bent on pulling the rest of the planet back into the middle ages, and perfectly willing to do it at the expense of millions of lives.

Terrorism by Islamic radicals certainly <i>is</i> a growing threat. <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2004_09_01_juancole_archive.html#109487993311862124">A recent article by Prof. Juan Cole</a> provides a fascinating analysis of the 'Islamic Empire' movement Bin Laden represents. 'They hate us because they hate freedom' is not only false, but blindingly simplistic. Al Qaeda's no longer an organization, but a movement. <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/terror-qaeda.html">Understanding its stated goals and assumptions is an absolute necessity</a>. Some imply that studying and understanding our enemy is tantamount to excusing atrocities. Seriously, do people believe this? Does 'trying to understand how a radical islamic terrorist sees the world' mean that we approve of killing civilians? If we're really at war, we should take it just as seriously as we take any other enemy. Whipping up a comforting charicature to bolster our feelings of righteousness does no one any good.

On the flip side, <i>The New Statesman</i> covers a growing sea change in the Islamic world -- a reassessment of the <i>sharia</i>, Islam's centuries-old body of traditional interperetation and law. Considered synonymous with the Koran by many conservative Muslims, it's where concepts like the <a href="http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=32655">triple talaq</a> can be found. Many of the offensively un-progressive practices considered a part of Islam are in fact part of the body of interperetation, not unlike corrupt, repressive traditions that dominated Christiandom in Europe during the middle ages. I'm a Christian -- I believe in concepts like 'right and wrong' and I believe that Islam isn't a true path to connection with God. That doesn't mean, though, that I'm not encouraged and excited by a growing movement towards reform in Islamic culture.

There's a struggle for the hearts and minds of the next generation in the Muslim world. My fear is that our nation's ham-fisted attempts to fight ideology with bulltes will tip the scales towards the radicals in the decades to come. Much street-level support for jihadists grows in the fertile soil of heavy-handed US intervention. Like it or not, aligning ourselves with the reformers might mobilize on-the-edge mideast cultures <i>against</i> reform in the current climate.  

We've seen that happen with the grass-roots democracy movement in Iran, thanks to the "Axis of Evil" rhetoric. We may yet see it in Iraq, when democratic elections allow the people to choose their future. Sadaam's government, while opressive and corrupt, was also manifestly secular -- the antithesis of the current jihadist movement. Now, as disenfranchised groups are given a voice in Iraqi society, <a href="http://content.gannettonline.com/gns/iraq/20040408-43933.shtml">more are calling for a religious government bound to the sharia</a>.

Are we willing to step back and allow the Islamic world to craft a new vision for its faith and culture? Christian culture went through similar growing pains centuries ago -- hopefully, we won't kill the same process as it happens in Islam.
