<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39211-2003Apr16.html" target="_blank">The former privacy officer of Internet advertising giant DoubleClick will be the Department of Homeland Security's first privacy czar, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge announced today.</a>

I'm just speechless. DoubleClick, for those who don't follow web news or whip themselves into a tizzy at EFF newsletters, is an online advertising firm. If you've seen a hellaciously annoying banner ad in the past few years, DoubleClick is most likely the source.

Let's put it this way. DoubleClick knows a lot about privacy, because they've been selling yours for the last several years. Putting a DoubleClick officer in charge of Homeland Security's privacy center is like putting a fox in charge of the Hen Protection Agency. I can't pull together enough outrage to sputter, really -- it's just absurd, and makes me want to laugh.
