It's been a slightly goofy week for politics, what with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12640-2005Feb9.html">the Gannon story</a> and all. Given the White House's tight control of press conferences, it's a little startling that a fellow with no journalistic background, no writing credits beyond a year-old political website, a collection of military-themed gay escort service domain names, and a <em><a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2005/02/10/gannon_affair/">fake name</a></em> would pass Secret Service background checks. But, as it turns out, he's been in White House briefings for a while, and the President calls on him by name. Well, false name at least. After the news about his adventures broke, <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/02/this-is-aol-profile-everyone-is.html">references to him have been scrubbed</a> on <a href="http://www.leadpencil.net/blog/archives/000234.html">political sites he was affiliated with</a>, and things got silly. All questions of political hackery aside, it makes one wonder. How many stunts like this before a terrorist group discovers that the easiest way to take out our government is to pose as a caucasian partisan hack? Apparently it's a free ticket past security for the leader of the country.

Perhaps that's why Congress is so keen on passing the new <a href="http://assembler.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001103----000-notes.html">ID-related laws</a>. Making sure drivers licenses are legitimate is important business, after all. Apparently, this particular law has legal experts and <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2005/02/index.html#005461">bloggers</a> alike somewhat alarmed. It includes provisions allowing the Dept. of Homeland Security to <em>set aside any laws necessary to expedite the building of security walls on the southern border.</em> Oh, and there's no judicial review. We wouldn't want to slow down the process of securing the country, after all. Safety regulations, property rights, child labor laws... Those are just grit in the gears of a smooth-running country, right? The problem isn't JUST that it's a tremendously insanely huge hole punched through the firewall of rule-by-law, it's also a scary-as-hell precedent. What other tasks are important enough that other laws shouldn't slow them down? Cracking down on drug dealers? Preventing copyright infringement? Stopping insurance fraud?

On <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2005/02/index.html#005461">TAPPED</a>, a House Aide was quoted:

<blockquote>I'd have to say that that really baffled us. Just trying to imagine what could possibly be the reason -- there's got to be a reason here other than the border fence. They're trying to set a precedent here. … The reason for this coming to Congress is much larger than 3 miles in San Diego. … It's just inconceivable that we're using all of this might for these three miles.</blockquote>

We'll see what happens when this puppy hits the Senate -- it's already passed the House by a decent margin.
