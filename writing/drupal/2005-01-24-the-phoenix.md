A <a href="http://www.therevealer.org/archives/timely_001528.php">fresh column</a> from <a href="http://www.therevealer.org"> The Revealer</a>, one of my personal favorites for religion-and-culture metacommentary. In the midst of a story about Raf, an enthused but inoffensively indie evangelical hipster, the writer pulls out a nugget of gold:

<blockquote>(Jay) Bakker tells Leland that he tries to avoid talking about abortion and homosexuality, that he's "just" about Jesus. Leland believes him, as if Jesus was ever about anything but everything. We learn that Bakker clashed with fellow seminarians he found too preppy, but we don't learn why. Was it all about style, as Leland suggests? Or were there theological differences? "Religion kills" is Bakker's motto, but it could also be said that religion distracts: "religion," after all, involves ideas that can be discussed, debated, differed on.
L., one of the friends I was sitting with that night, said at one point that the so-called "emerging church" represented the future of American Christendom. That's hard to believe -- Raf isn't going to lead anyone anywhere, and Bakker wouldn't be in the news were it not for the scandal of his father and the camp glory of his mother.
But L. qualified her claim. The future of the church, she said, lies neither in the creaky old bitterness of Jim Dobson nor in the hipster enclaves with names like Revolution, Rejects, and Journey. The future will emerge, said L., from the failure of such endeavors.</blockquote>

These are questions that I've been pondering for a while, too. For all of the talk about the Emerging Church, New Models, and so on, is there really any inoffensive middle ground? I don't think so. What we really need -- what *I* really need -- is to figure out how to hold sincere, heartfelt convictions with love and kindness. That's a hurdle that's far harder to jump than order-of-service revisions and modern-rock worship.
