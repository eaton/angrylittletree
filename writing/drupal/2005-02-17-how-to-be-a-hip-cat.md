There's something deliriously, deliciously clueless about earnestly serious slang glossaries. Whether it's <a href="http://www.jiveaces.com">Scientologists explaining hipster lingo</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/children/kidtalk.mspx">Microsoft warning parents about 13375p35k</a>, it always tends toward the giggle-inducing. Witness this passage from Microsoft's parent-education page, "A Parent's primer to computer slang."

<blockquote>While it's important to respect your children's privacy, understanding what your teenager's online slang means and how to decipher it is important as you help guide their online experience. While it has many nicknames, information-age slang is commonly referred to as leetspeek, or leet for short...
<ul>
<li>"warez" or "w4r3z": Illegally copied software available for download.</li>
<li>"h4x": Read as "hacks," or what a computer hacker does.</li>
<li>"sploitz" (short for exploits): Vulnerabilities in computer software used by hackers.</li>
<li>"pwn": A typo-deliberate version of own, a slang term that means to dominate. This could also be spelled "0\/\/n3d" or "pwn3d," among other variations. Online video game bullies or "griefers" often use this term.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

I suppose they have to wait for Leetspeak 201, the advanced course, before tackling advanced bits like <em>p\/\/nzord!</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">WikiPedia has an article</a> that's even more detailed, though it lacks Microsoft's gently alarmist paternal tone.

<strong>UPDATE!</strong> While the Jive Aces took their 'Swing Speak' lingo guide off the current web site, The Internet Wayback Machine brings us <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000511150030/http://www.jiveaces.com/">the old version</a>. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000531165823/http://www.jiveaces.com/PlanetJ/words/index.htm">Soak up that delicious hipness, people</a>.
