Observations about New York:

<ul>

<li>Pedestrians are aggressive, and cars stop for <i>them</i>. Street traffic and foot traffic seem to exist in a homogenized mix here, with traffic lights only indicating where the heaviest flow is currently going. It's fascinating.</li>

<li>Chicago may have the best deep dish in the world, but I think we should be willing to conceded the Thin Crust Crown. Holy <i>cow</i> is the pizza here good.</li>

<li>A nontrivial percentage of the population actually does dress like they're auditioning for Sex And The City. I tripped over more twiggy, heavy-lidded makeup models with gigantic furry hats <i>on one subway ride</i> than I thought actually existed in the wild. Is LA like this? I hear about this fierce LA/New York rivalry, but I'm a simple Midwestern boy. We're too busy herding our cows and chewing straw to pay too much attention.</li>

<li>Soho is cool, and I like the shops there. If the traffic weren't o heavy and the weather weren't so bitterly cold, it'd be fun to just spend a day or two poking around and browsing and eating at vegetarian pasta cafes, etc.</li>

<li>I managed to swing by <a href="http://www.purlsoho.com/purl">Purl,</a> an awesome little textiles/crafts/knitting suply shop, and pick up some fun stuff for Catherine. (Shhhhh. Don't tell her, it's a surprise.) The store is awesome, but also dazzlingly packed with yawns and fabric and needles and so on. Like, thousands of patterns. Jillions even. I felt dizzy.</li>

<li>The Apple Store is three blocks from my hotel room. It is a shrine to geekiness. Naturally, I used a digital camera to record a movie of it.</li>

</ul>

So. All in all, New York is cool. If I ever come back I think I'll have to bring the Canon; I don't think I could live with myself if I didn't get some high quality shots of the assorted bits of city life. But I'm ready to scamper back home now, and watch movies and play cribbage and be with Catherine. My everyday life is good, and I'm eager to get back to it.
