Catherine and I really love our house. I say <i>house</i> because it feels like one, though technically it's a duplex. Originally built in the 1800s, it's been kept up nicely and has beautiful wooden trim. The only problem is <i>George</i>.

George is a cute little dog, full of tail-wiggling and good intentions. He belongs to the woman who lives in the other half of the house. When she's out, George is lonely. And when George is lonely, he <i>yips.</i> She's handled things well and has tried to keep George quiet, with varying degrees of success. Still, Catherine has had to sit through some hours-long yipping sessions, and it gets a bit maddening.

Last week, I came home from work to find Catherine grinning victoriously. On the other side of the house's shared door, George was yipping madly.

<i>"Guess what I figured out."</i>

After a few fruitless guesses involving pineapples and elephants, I gave up. The yipping continued. Catherine walked over to the door and spoke, firmly but not unkindly.

<i>"George? Be quiet."</i>

The yipping stopped. Silence, blessed silence. Catherine turned to me, still grinning.

<i>"Good dog, George."</i>

Sometimes, the simplest solution is the best one.
