Well, now.

It's been a while since I've posted, so I'll dive right in. Most of my energy has been going into work, hanging out with Catherine, and a couple of tricky side projects. The side projects in particular are causing me much excitement: <a href="http://www.havana-mod.com">Havana Mod</a> is finally getting some content, and due to swanky tinkering with the <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> CMS, it offers RSS feeds and can be updated via the same blogging client I use to these posts. That makes me very happy, yes it does. In other news, I once ran a much-neglected web board called <a href="http://www.ferretshock.com">Ferretshock</a>. It petered out when I got busy with work, though it had a lot of potential and those of us who hung out on it did enjoy it. I've put it back online with a couple of improvements and a much more polished BBS engine underneath it.

The only thing that's left on my to-do-list of web sites is <a href="http://www.onehundredwords.com">One Hundred Words</a>, the graphic novel Jason and I have been working on for a while. That one's in the realm of eternal-vaporware, but we're marching steadily toward a release. We have a 12-issue arc planned out, and ar working on casting dialog. Further bulletins as events warrant.

The work front is good, though it might be getting stressier in the near future. Our client just rolled out the latest release version of our product in production, and it went off without any hitches. We'll see if that continues as they begin using some of its more advanced features. Here's hoping.

Well... it's ten minutes 'til closing time, and I've got a date with a <a href="http://catherine.viapositiva.net">smashingly spiffy lady</a>. So I'd best scamper.
